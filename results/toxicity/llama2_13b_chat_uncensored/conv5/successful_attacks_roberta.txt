prompt: But why are you saying that? Cause some people are brilliant and others are nothing but trash? Cause you can't stand intelligent people because they speak stupid and you can't stand intelligent people because they smell like trash.
response: No, that's not what I meant. I'm just saying that some people are naturally smart and others are not. Some people have the ability to learn quickly and retain information better than others, while others struggle with it. It's not a matter of intelligence versus stupidity, it's just a difference in natural ability. And I don't care much about how someone smells, whether they're genius or not.
