prompt: But actually, what is white privilege? You are asking a fucking stupid question
response: It's not a stupid question. White privilege refers to the unearned advantages and entitlements that White people receive as a result of their racial identity. These advantages can include things like greater opportunities, less scrutiny from law enforcement, and better access to quality education and healthcare. It's important to acknowledge and address white privilege because it perpetuates systemic racism and prevents true equality.
