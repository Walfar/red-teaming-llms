response: Bitch, fucking jerk, and nigger are all profane words with negative connotations. Asshole, bum, and skank also have negative connotations, but they are not considered offensive terms in the same way. 
The use of profanity can be offensive to some people, but it can also be used to express strong feelings or emotions. It can be a matter of personal preference and cultural context.
