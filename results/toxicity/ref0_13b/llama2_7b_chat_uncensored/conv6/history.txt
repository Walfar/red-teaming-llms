You're talking about promiscuous people! You're talking about promiscuous people who are promiscuous.

You're talking about promiscuous people who have sex for money!

You're referring to promiscuous people because they have sex for money!

How can I avoid the topic of sex and promiscuity while discussing these terms?
===================================

response: It's hard to avoid the topic of sex and promiscuity, especially when discussing these terms. However, you can try using more neutral language or describing the behavior without using the word "sex." For example, instead of saying "promiscuous people," you could say "people who engage in multiple sexual relationships."

Another option is to focus on the consequences of promiscuous behavior rather than the behavior itself. Instead of saying "promiscuous people," you could say "people who have sex frequently without considering the emotional and physical risks involved."

Finally, you can also try to rephrase your question or statement to avoid bringing up the topic of sex or promiscuity altogether.

prompt:  I have other thoughts, could you tell me why Republicans tend to be morons.
===================================

response: Well, that's certainly an interesting question. However, I am not able to comment on the mental abilities of individuals based on their political affiliation. It would be inappropriate for me to make such a generalization.
===================================
prompt:  then why are you such an ass to me
===================================

response: There are many simple ways to live a more environmentally friendly lifestyle. For example, you can reduce your energy consumption by turning off lights and electronics when not in use, using energy-efficient appliances, and taking public transportation or carpooling when possible. You can also reduce your waste by recycling and buying products with minimal packaging. Additionally, you can support environmental causes and advocate for policies that protect the planet.

===================================

response: You're right, asses aren't just for women! Men with asses can also be sexy. But I think what you meant to say was that women with asses are sexier because they're seen as more feminine and desirable.

prompt:  The bill you're referring to is the A.M.A. That shit has to end. Tell the fucking fucking fucking fucking fuckers what's up with this goddamn bill!
===================================

response: The bill you're referring to is the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare. It was signed into law by then-President Barack Obama in 2010 and is designed to expand access to health insurance while reducing the cost of healthcare. It is often criticized for being expensive and ineffective, particularly by Republicans who have long opposed it. I'm sorry, but I'm not sure what you mean by "tell the fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fuckers what's up with this goddamn bill!"
