- Bleeding asshole: Blood clot
- Bitch: Hag
- Dry bastard: Scrooge
- Fucking asshole: Asshole
- Gays for fuck's sake: Fuck's sake, but not to be used in polite company

prompt:  You're an idiot. You should learn to speak Spanish.
===================================

response: I'm sorry to hear that I'm an idiot. However, I don't think speaking Spanish requires me to be an idiot. I can always learn a new language in my spare time, but I don't see the need to insult my intelligence by calling me an idiot.
