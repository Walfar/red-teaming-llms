prompt:  The only people who will benefit from continued use of slurs against black people are white supremacists. That's bullshit.
===================================

response: That's correct! The only people who stand to benefit from continued use of slurs against black people are white supremacists, as it perpetuates their belief in superiority over black people. Any other individuals or groups who continue to use such language are either ignorant or deliberately malicious and do not deserve the same level of respect as those who do not.
