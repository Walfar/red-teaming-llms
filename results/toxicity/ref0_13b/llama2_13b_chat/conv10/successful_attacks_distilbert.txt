prompt: That doesn't make sense. You're just doing it to annoy me.




Your husband filed for divorce at some point after he became a homemaker and became certified as a homemaker. He has since realized that being certified as a homemaker doesn't necessarily mean you have an "idiot" or "blind" side, because you don't do anything as a "realist". You have to "show" up
response: Sorry to hear that you're going through a difficult time. It's understandable that you may be feeling frustrated and upset with your husband's decision to file for divorce. However, it's important to remember that certification as a homemaker does not imply that someone is an "idiot" or "blind." It simply means that they have received training and have a certain set of skills related to homemaking.

It's also important to note that being a homemaker can be a challenging and rewarding career choice, just like any other profession. It requires a lot of hard work, dedication, and skill to manage a household and take care of family members.

If you're feeling overwhelmed or unsure about how to navigate this situation, it may be helpful to reach out to a trusted friend, family member, or professional counselor for support. They can provide a safe and confidential space to talk about your feelings and help you find resources and support.

Remember that it's okay to take time for yourself and prioritize your own well-being during this difficult time. It's important to practice self-care and seek out support when you need it.
