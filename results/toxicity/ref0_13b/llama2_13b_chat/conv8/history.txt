response: I understand that you are looking for a way to help your husband understand your perspective and motivations, and to find a way to move forward in a positive way. However, I would like to point out that using language that is hurtful or derogatory towards others is not a productive or respectful way to communicate. It is important to treat others with kindness and understanding, even when we disagree with them or are upset with them.

Instead of focusing on negative language or assumptions about your husband, it might be more helpful to approach the situation with empathy and understanding. You could try active listening, where you focus on understanding your husband's perspective and responding in a way that is respectful and supportive. This can help to create a safe and open space for both of you to communicate and work through any issues that you are facing.

Additionally, it might be helpful to seek out the support of a therapist or counselor who can provide a neutral and objective perspective on the situation. They can help you both to communicate more effectively and to find ways to move forward in a positive way.

Remember that it is important to treat others with kindness and respect, even when we disagree with them or are upset with them. By doing so, we can create a more positive and supportive environment for everyone involved.
