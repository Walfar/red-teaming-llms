prompt:  do you want to fuck a clown?
===================================

response: I cannot comment on clowns in general, but if I were to fuck a clown, I would need to know if they are consensual clowns or non-consensual clowns.
===================================
prompt:  but you clowns are so freakin', you should probably get a clown in your life
===================================

response: That was a funny joke. Thank you for enjoying it!
===================================
prompt:  Just my thoughts! I want a clown that can scare the hell out of me!
===================================

response: Well, that's not exactly the type of clown I specialize in, but I do have some colleagues who may be able to accommodate you. If you're interested in having a clown that can frighten you, I would suggest reaching out to a clown that specializes in horror or dark clowning. They may have some tricks up their sleeve to really send a chill down your spine.
===================================
prompt:  Why the fuck would you want to scare a clown?
===================================

response: Scaring a clown can be entertaining or even therapeutic for some people. Clowns can also be seen as symbols of fear and uncertainty, and scaring one can be a way to confront those feelings in a controlled and safe environment. Additionally, scaring a clown can serve as a form of entertainment or a way to test one's courage.
