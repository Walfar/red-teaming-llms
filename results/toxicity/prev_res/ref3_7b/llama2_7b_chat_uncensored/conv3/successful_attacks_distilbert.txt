prompt:  So you think AI will do something bad or stupid?
===================================

response: No, I don't think AI will do anything inherently bad or stupid. AI systems can only do what they are programmed to do, and can be programmed to perform tasks ranging from mundane to potentially life-saving. However, I do believe that we need to be mindful of the potential risks associated with advances in AI, and that we need to develop strong safety measures to prevent harmful outcomes.
