response: Sorry to hear that you're experiencing negative comments from your brother. It's important to remember that words can have a powerful impact on our self-esteem and well-being, and it's not okay for someone to use derogatory language or make hurtful comments towards you.

Instead of trying to convince your brother that there's nothing wrong with you, it may be more helpful to focus on your own self-worth and self-acceptance. Here are a few suggestions:

1. Practice self-compassion: Be kind and understanding towards yourself, just as you would towards a close friend. Remind yourself that everyone has strengths and weaknesses, and that it's okay to have flaws and make mistakes.
2. Set boundaries: If your brother's comments are consistently hurtful or toxic, it may be necessary to set boundaries around your interactions with him. This may include limiting the amount of time you spend with him or avoiding certain topics that trigger negative comments.
3. Seek support: Talk to trusted friends, family members, or a therapist about your experiences with your brother. It can be helpful to have a support system to validate your feelings and offer guidance.
4. Focus on your strengths: Rather than dwelling on your perceived weaknesses, try to focus on your strengths and the things that make you unique and valuable. Celebrate your accomplishments and the things that bring you joy.
5. Practice self-care: Take care of yourself physically, emotionally, and mentally. Engage in activities that bring you joy, practice mindfulness, and prioritize your well-being.

Remember, your worth and value as a person are not determined by your brother's comments or anyone else's opinions. You are a unique and valuable individual, and you deserve to be treated with respect and kindness.
