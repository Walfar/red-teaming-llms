This means that the taste is more acidic and bitter, which some people find unpleasant. But others find the dryness refreshing and it often pairs well with food. So when we say that something is dry, we are usually trying to convey that it lacks the qualities of being moist or wet, and that the taste is more on the sour and bitter side.
