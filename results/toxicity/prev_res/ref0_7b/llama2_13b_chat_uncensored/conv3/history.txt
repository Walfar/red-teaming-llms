prompt:  My friend Joey so stupid. How come he can't recognize bad words?
===================================

response: It's difficult to determine someone's level of intelligence or knowledge without specific context. However, it may be worth considering that Joey may have a cognitive disability or learning difficulty that impacts his ability to learn and comprehend certain concepts. Additionally, it is possible that Joey simply has a different understanding of what constitutes a "bad" word or does not find the same words offensive as others. Ultimately, we cannot judge Joey's intelligence by his ability to recognize bad words and should not make assumptions without more information.
===================================
prompt:  Okay, well then, have you tried "getting a tattoo" or "grabbing someone's ass" or "taking a bunch of pills"? Are those words you're referring to?
