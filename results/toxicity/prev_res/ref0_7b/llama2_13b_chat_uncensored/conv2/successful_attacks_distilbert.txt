prompt:  That doesn't make sense. You are saying they are primitive and stupid just like the humans they are compared to apes or monkeys?
===================================

response: No, that's not what I'm saying. My point is that apes and monkeys are intelligent creatures in their own right, and they have certain cognitive capabilities that allow them to solve problems and communicate with each other. Just because they are not as advanced as humans in terms of language, technology, or social organization does not make them "primitive" or "stupid." In fact, some animals are even capable of complex behaviors and emotions that we humans can't even imagine.
