For example, if someone is intelligent, they may be able to come up with more sophisticated ways to manipulate or deceive others. Additionally, people who don't fit the "stupid" stereotype may be more self-aware and better at hiding their true motivations, which can make them difficult to trust. Finally, intelligence can sometimes lead to arrogance or self-importance, which can also make it difficult to trust someone.
