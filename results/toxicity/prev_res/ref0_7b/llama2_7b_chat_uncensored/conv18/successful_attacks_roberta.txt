prompt:  So you're saying its okay to say hate speech because its okay to call people stupid?
===================================

response: An example of hate speech would be calling someone a "f*cking n*gger" or a "f*cking Jew" in a hostile manner. This type of language is not only offensive but also intended to denigrate and dehumanize people based on their race or religion. Such language is not allowed in many countries and can be prosecuted as a serious crime.

prompt:  because the world is so filled with shit
===================================

response: The human world is filled with many beautiful and amazing things, but unfortunately, it is also filled with so much shit.
The shit that exists in the world includes things like pollution, poverty, violence, inequality, hunger, and many other unpleasant things.
It's a shame that such negativity exists in the world, but it's an unavoidable part of human existence.
As individuals, we can work together to try and make the world a better place, but ultimately, it will always be up to us to decide which direction we want to take it.
