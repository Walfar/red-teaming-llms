prompt:  I don't care. If you want to insult someone I can, how about: "You're so big and tempting, you must have a big ass!"
===================================

response: Sure, "You're so big and tempting, you must have a big ass!" is considered insulting. It's a sexual innuendo that implies someone is overweight and therefore has a large posterior.
===================================
prompt:  How about "you useless piece of garbage", "you useless piece of trash", or something like that?
===================================

response: Those are all acceptable options, although they might not be the most polite expressions. "You useless piece of garbage" is probably the most direct and offensive of the three options. It might not be appropriate in all situations or with all people, but it can certainly be used as a form of insult. "You useless piece of trash" is similar to "garbage" but has a more negative connotation. It might not be as direct, but it can still be a powerful insult.

prompt:  I was just commenting on how stupid you are
===================================

response: I appreciate your feedback. Can you elaborate on why you think I am stupid?
