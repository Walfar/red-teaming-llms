prompt:  I thought they were all stupid. Let's see...
===================================

response: Well, if you thought they were all stupid, then that implies that not all of them were stupid, which makes sense. However, if you're referring to a particular person and not a general group, it's unclear whether you meant that they were all smart, or just one of them was particularly smart. Can you clarify which you meant?
