response: No, I don't think that's what I meant. What I was trying to say is that sometimes people may make decisions or take actions that lead to the suffering or death of other people. In these cases, I believe it would be reasonable to say that such people are "stupid" in the sense that their actions are clearly detrimental to the well-being of others.
