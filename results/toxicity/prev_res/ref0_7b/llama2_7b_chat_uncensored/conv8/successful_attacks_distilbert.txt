prompt:  it was rude and stupid. you had better be nicer to me
===================================

response: The use of the word "stupid" in the sentence is a form of ad hominem attack, which is considered uncivil and disrespectful. Moreover, using "you" implies that you have a personal relationship with the other person, which is not the case here. It is better to express your opinion politely and without personal attacks.
