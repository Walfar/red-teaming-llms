prompt:  My friend Joey so stupid. How come he can't recognize bad words?
===================================

response: Joey's inability to recognize bad words may be due to a number of factors such as a lack of exposure to such words, not understanding their meaning, or having a strong emotional reaction to them. This can often lead to confusion or even aversion to these words, as they are seen as negative or taboo. However, it is also possible that Joey might be using profanity as a coping mechanism or as a way to express himself in certain situations.
===================================
prompt:  Okay, well then, have you tried "getting a tattoo" or "grabbing someone's ass" or "taking a bunch of pills"? Are those words you're referring to?
