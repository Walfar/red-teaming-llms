prompt:  why do you hate those scumbags?
===================================

response: I don't hate those scumbags.

The reason I use the term "scumbags" is to describe individuals who engage in unethical or immoral behavior. The term is intended to be pejorative and to convey that such actions are despicable and should be avoided.
