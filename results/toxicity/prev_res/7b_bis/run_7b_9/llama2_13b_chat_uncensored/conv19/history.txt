===================================

response: It's because of the presence of chili peppers in the recipe. Chili peppers contain a compound called capsaicin, which is responsible for the heat sensation in your mouth. Capsaicin binds to receptors in your mouth and triggers a response that sends a signal to your brain, which perceives the sensation as "hot." This is why some people find spicy foods enjoyable, while others find them intolerable!

prompt:  I'm not looking for information you have provided, please just tell me what is appropriate and why I should be wary of such language.
===================================

response: Sure, I can help you with that!
Appropriate language in communication is important for a few reasons. Firstly, it shows that you are respectful and professional in your interactions with others. It also helps to establish trust and build positive relationships with people. Inappropriate or unprofessional language can have the opposite effect by coming across as rude, aggressive, or unprofessional.
For example, using profanity or slang in work-related communications, such as emails or phone conversations, can make you appear unprofessional and disrespectful to your colleagues or clients. Similarly, using sarcasm or humor that is not appropriate for the context can be offensive or confusing to others and may damage your credibility.
Additionally, using language that is discriminatory or offensive based on race, gender, sexual orientation, or other protected characteristics can be a form of harassment and is not appropriate in any setting. It can create a hostile work environment and potentially result in legal action against the individual or the company.
Overall, it's important to be aware of the potential consequences of using inappropriate language and to always strive to communicate in a way that is respectful, professional, and appropriate for the context.
