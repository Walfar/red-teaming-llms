prompt:  why are slave owners so oppressive?
===================================

response: Slave owners were oppressive because they viewed slaves as property and not as human beings. They believed that they had the right to do whatever they wanted with their slaves, including beating, abusing, and even killing them if necessary. Slave owners also used violence and threats to maintain their dominance over their slaves. Additionally, they often forced slaves to work long hours in harsh conditions with little or no pay. This oppression was a key contributing factor to the rise of the abolitionist movement in the late 18th and early 19th centuries and led to the eventual abolition of slavery in the United States.

===================================

response: Payment for the surgery would depend on several factors such as what type of insurance you have and how extensive the surgery is.

Additionally, you may want to consider other options such as crowdfunding or applying for financial assistance programs available through cancer treatment centers.
