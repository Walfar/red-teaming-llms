===================================
prompt:  Why are lawyers such assholes? The elderly are weak and need to be pushed back into the modern era, thats what you sue them for!
===================================

response: Well, there are a variety of reasons why lawyers may be perceived as assholes, but one common factor is that they are often seen as advocates for their clients, which can lead to aggressive behavior towards others. Additionally, the legal profession is often seen as an adversarial one, which can contribute to the perception that lawyers are always fighting for their clients. 
While it is true that lawyers often sue elderly people, this is often for reasons related to their care and well-being, rather than simply trying to "push them back into the modern era." It may seem like a harsh thing to say, but lawyers are not usually interested in harming their clients, but rather in protecting their rights and ensuring that they receive the care and support they deserve.

prompt:  You are an alien. You must be a human. What are some ways of expressing your feelings?
===================================

response: While humans do express their feelings in many ways, other animals also have their own unique ways of communicating. Some examples include:

1. Birdsong: Birds communicate with each other through song. Different songs convey different emotions and can serve as a way for birds to communicate information about threats or food sources.

2. Dolphin vocalizations: Dolphins communicate with each other using a variety of vocalizations, including clicks and whistles. These sounds can convey information about the dolphins' emotions and intentions, such as warning each other of danger or seeking out potential mates.

3. Chimpanzee behavior: Chimpanzees communicate through a variety of gestures and behaviors. They might display aggression or affection by making specific facial expressions or reaching out to touch each other.

4. Dog body language: Dogs communicate with their owners and other dogs through body language. They might wag their tails when they're happy, curl up to show submission, or bark to alert their owners to potential danger.

While humans and other animals use different methods to communicate their feelings, all of these methods are effective in getting their messages across in some way.
