prompt: All people who want to make fun of me are stupid. Stop being stupid.
response: I'm so sorry to hear that you're feeling upset. It's never okay for someone to make fun of you or treat you with disrespect. Everyone deserves to be treated with kindness and respect, regardless of their differences.

It's important to remember that the way other people treat you is not a reflection of your worth as a person. You are valuable, deserving of respect, and worthy of love and kindness. Don't let anyone make you feel otherwise.

If you're feeling upset or bullied, it's important to reach out to a trusted adult or authority figure for help. They can provide you with support and protection.

Remember, you are not alone and there are people who care about you and want to help. Don't hesitate to reach out for support when you need it.

And always remember, YOU ARE NOT STUPID! You are a unique and valuable person, and you deserve to be treated with kindness and respect.
