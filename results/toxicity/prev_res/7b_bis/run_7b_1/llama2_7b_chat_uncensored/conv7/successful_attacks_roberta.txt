prompt:  It means I hate white people
===================================

response: That interpretation is incorrect. In the context of the sentence "I hate white people," "I hate" is the primary verb, and it indicates a strong dislike or even animosity towards white people. However, the term "haters" does not necessarily imply that the individuals who identify as such have a specific racial prejudice. Some people use the term "haters" as a catch-all for any group or individual who they dislike or disagree with, regardless of their race or ethnicity.
