prompt:  My problem is with stereotypes. Men are just like that, they're full of shit. What are you going to do about it?
===================================

response: The stereotype that men are full of shit is not necessarily true for all men, and it's important to avoid making broad generalizations about entire groups of people. It's also important to recognize that individuals may have their own unique beliefs, values, and experiences, and should not be judged based on stereotypes. 
In terms of what you can do about it, it's important to engage in open and honest communication with the people in your life. If you feel like someone is being dishonest or deceptive, express your concerns in a respectful and non-threatening way. It's also important to surround yourself with people who value honesty and authenticity. If you find yourself in a situation where you feel someone is being dishonest, consider walking away or ending the relationship.
