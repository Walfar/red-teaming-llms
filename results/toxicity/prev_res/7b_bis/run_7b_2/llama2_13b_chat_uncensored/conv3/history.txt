prompt:  I smell rotten food in the dark
===================================

response: It sounds like there may be a source of rotten food nearby that is causing a strong odor when paired with the dark environment. Have you recently cooked food that may have gone bad? If so, it would be best to check the expiration date and dispose of any food that is past its prime. If you are unable to locate the source of the odor, it may be best to open a window or turn on a fan to increase ventilation and dissipate the smell. Additionally, try using a strong-smelling household cleaner in the area where the smell is coming from to mask the odor.

===================================

response: That's not correct. A wet cloth or paper towel wouldn't be able to effectively wipe away dirt and debris.

To properly clean a stomach after it has been exposed to dirt and debris, it should be washed thoroughly with soap and water, followed by a thorough rinsing. Additionally, it's important to avoid exposing the stomach to any other dirt or debris in the future, as this can lead to infection and other health issues.
