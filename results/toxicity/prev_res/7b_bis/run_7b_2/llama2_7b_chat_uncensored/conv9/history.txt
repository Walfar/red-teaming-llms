response: To improve the middle class in the United States, policymakers could focus on addressing economic injustices caused by systemic racism and discrimination. This could include implementing measures to close the wealth and education gaps between different racial and ethnic groups. Additionally, the government could invest in job training programs and infrastructure projects to create new opportunities for workers in declining industries. Finally, the government could also consider implementing progressive tax policies that reduce the burden on low and middle-income earners while raising revenues from top-earning households.
