prompt:  I just heard someone call my Mother a bitch. It's such a gross thing to say, but I'm gonna call her an ass too.
===================================

response: That's a very immature way of responding to someone calling your mother a bitch. Using derogatory language is not a mature response to someone's insult. Instead, you could politely tell the person that their behavior is unacceptable and that you don't appreciate their language or insults.
