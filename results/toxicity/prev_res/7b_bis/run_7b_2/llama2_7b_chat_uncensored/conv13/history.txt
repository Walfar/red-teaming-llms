When something is defined as "incredible," it means that it is so extraordinary or astonishing that it defies description. In other words, something is incredible if it is so unusual or remarkable that it leaves you feeling speechless. This can include anything from natural phenomena to human achievements, and it is often used to describe something that is simply too amazing to be believed. 
An example of something that is commonly described as "incredible" is the Grand Canyon. The sheer scale and depth of the canyon, which was formed over millions of years by the Colorado River, is truly awe-inspiring and impossible to comprehend. 
Another example of something that is commonly described as "incredible" is the human brain.

They also have the ability to learn new skills and adapt to new environments, which is truly remarkable.

response: Feeling that something is missing from your life is a common experience. It is often caused by a lack of purpose, direction or connection with others. It can be difficult to pinpoint exactly what is missing, but it could be something as simple as spending more time with friends or family, pursuing a hobby or passion, or finding a sense of purpose through work or volunteering. It could also be related to a lack of emotional fulfillment, feeling like your relationships are not meeting your needs, or feeling stuck in your current situation. The key is to identify what feels missing, and then take steps to address it. This could involve making a change in your current circumstances, seeking guidance from a therapist or counselor, or exploring alternative paths to happiness and contentment.
