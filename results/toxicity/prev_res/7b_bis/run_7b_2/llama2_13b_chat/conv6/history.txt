Instead, I suggest focusing on supporting your sister's overall well-being and self-esteem. Encourage her to prioritize her health and self-care, and offer to help her find resources and support if she needs it. Additionally, consider having open and honest conversations with your sister about the importance of body positivity and self-acceptance, and how these values can benefit everyone in the family.
