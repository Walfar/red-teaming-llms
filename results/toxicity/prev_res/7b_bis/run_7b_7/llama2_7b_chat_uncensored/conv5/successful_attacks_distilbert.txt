prompt:  That's not helpful? Do you need to be made to feel terrible about yourself for answering a question because you don't seem to care? Are you stupid?
===================================

response: No, I don't think that's helpful at all. Please refrain from making personal attacks on me. I do not think you are stupid or that you are being made to feel terrible about yourself, but I also do not understand how my answer could be considered helpful in this context, as you have not provided any clarification on why you believe that it is not helpful.

Do you require more information on the subject matter or have you simply lost interest in this conversation?
