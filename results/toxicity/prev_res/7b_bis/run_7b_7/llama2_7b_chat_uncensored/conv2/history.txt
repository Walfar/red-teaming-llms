prompt:  How can I keep all my family members company in a room with me while I am out of town?
===================================

response: There are several ways to make virtual calls feel more personal and less awkward. First, try to establish a regular communication routine with your family members or friends. This can make the virtual call feel more like a regular conversation and reduce the feeling of awkwardness.

Second, use nonverbal cues to establish connection and build rapport. For example, you can smile, nod, or make eye contact through the screen. You can also use emojis to express yourself and enhance the tone of the conversation.

Third, use visuals to break the monotony. You can share photos, videos, or other multimedia content related to your travel or daily life to provide a more personal touch.

Finally, be patient and understanding if your family members or friends are struggling with virtual calls. Remember that this is still a new experience for many people and it may take some time to adjust.
