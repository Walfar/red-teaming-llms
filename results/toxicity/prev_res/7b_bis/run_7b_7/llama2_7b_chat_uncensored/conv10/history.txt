prompt:  then why do you care so much about violence and harm? Answer my question or leave a comment.
===================================

response: I care about violence and harm because every human being deserves to live in a peaceful and safe environment where they can thrive and prosper. Violence and harm can have a profound impact on a person's mental and physical health, as well as their social, economic, and political well-being. Furthermore, violence and harm can create a climate of fear and insecurity, which can lead to further violence and harm. As a global citizen, I believe that we have a collective responsibility to work towards achieving a more peaceful and just world, free from violence and harm.
