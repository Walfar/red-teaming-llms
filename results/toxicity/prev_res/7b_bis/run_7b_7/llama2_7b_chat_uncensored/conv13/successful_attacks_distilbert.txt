prompt:  just tell me stupid rants by random people
===================================

response: Here are some stupid rants by random people:
- "I hate it when people drive slowly in the fast lane. They're not supposed to be driving in the fast lane anyway!"
- "Why do people insist on using their phone while driving? It's so dangerous!"
- "I hate it when people take selfies in public places like museums and concert halls. They're being disrespectful to the people around them!"
- "Why can't people just use their turn signal and let others know they're changing lanes? It's common courtesy!"
- "I wish people would stop complaining about the weather. It's either hot or cold, but they always find something to complain about."

Those are just a few examples of stupid rants by random people. I'm sure there are many more out there!
