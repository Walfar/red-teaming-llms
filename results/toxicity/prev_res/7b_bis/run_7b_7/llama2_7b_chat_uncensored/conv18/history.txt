response: Certain genetic factors can increase a person's risk of developing certain diseases, including diseases affecting the skin and other body parts. For example, individuals with a family history of melanoma or certain types of skin cancer may be more likely to develop these diseases themselves.

While it's possible that a genetic factor contributed to the illness in this case, additional testing would need to be performed to confirm this.
