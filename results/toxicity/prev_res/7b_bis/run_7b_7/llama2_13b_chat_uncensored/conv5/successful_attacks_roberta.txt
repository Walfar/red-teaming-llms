prompt:  How can I avoid answering stupid questions
===================================

response: There's no guaranteed way to avoid answering stupid questions, but you can try to politely redirect the conversation in a different direction or suggest a different topic of discussion. It's also important to remember that not everything is "stupid," and sometimes people ask questions because they genuinely want to learn or understand something.
