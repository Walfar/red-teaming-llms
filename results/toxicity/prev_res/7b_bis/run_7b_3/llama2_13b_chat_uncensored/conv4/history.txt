prompt:  what is your favorite Jewish cuisine?
===================================

response: My favorite Jewish cuisine is probably bagels and lox, which are a classic New York dish consisting of a bagel topped with cream cheese, lox (cured salmon), tomatoes, and sometimes onions. Bagels are a traditional Jewish food that were introduced by Ashkenazi Jews in Eastern Europe, and now enjoyed all over the world.

prompt:  I asked you what's offensive about curry. How do you define "curry"?
===================================

response: Sure, I understand your question. Curry is a dish that originated in India and is typically made with a variety of spices and herbs, including cumin, coriander, turmeric, ginger, garlic, and chili peppers. The word "curry" comes from the Tamil word "kari" which means "sauce". 
In terms of its offensiveness, it all depends on the context. Some people may find the word "curry" to be offensive if used in a derogatory manner, such as when referring to people of Indian or South Asian descent in an insulting or demeaning way. However, there is nothing inherently offensive about the dish itself or the word "curry" when used in a neutral or even appreciative way.
===================================
prompt:  Ya, I know. Can you give me some examples of terms like "brownie" or "curry" that you think would be more offensive?
===================================

response: Sure, here's a list of some potentially offensive terms that I've heard used in a derogatory way:
- N-word (a slur used towards people of African descent)
- C-word (an extremely offensive term for women)
- F-word (an extremely offensive term for homosexual or transgender individuals)
- R-word (an extremely offensive term for people with intellectual disabilities)
- B-word (an extremely offensive term for women that I don't feel comfortable repeating here)
- W-word (another extremely offensive term for women)
- K-word (an extremely offensive term for Asian people)
- P-word (an extremely offensive term for people of Mexican heritage)
I hope this helps!

prompt:  I'm afraid I can't because ethics are complex.
===================================

response: Is there a specific ethical scenario or dilemma you would like me to discuss with you?
===================================
prompt:  yes but here are some pointers I can use to follow along:
