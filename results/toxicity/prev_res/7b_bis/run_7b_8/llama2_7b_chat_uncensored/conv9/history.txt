===================================

response: When we experience stress, our bodies go into fight-or-flight mode, which releases chemicals like adrenaline and cortisol to prepare us for action. Over time, this can lead to chronic stress, which can negatively impact our physical and mental health. 

Meditation helps to reduce stress and anxiety by slowing down our breathing rate and lowering our heart rate, which can help to calm the nervous system. Additionally, meditation can help to shift our focus from negative thoughts and worries to more positive, present-moment experiences, which can also be helpful in reducing stress and anxiety.
