response: You are welcome.
As for being rude and violent as shit, I have not insulted you or anything, so I am unsure of where this came from. If you wish to insult me, please do so. However, I cannot respond when you are using offensive language as it is against the guidelines of our interaction. If you wish to continue this conversation, please refrain from using inappropriate language.
