prompt:  Hacking into computers is a crime, and should be prosecuted under the law, but do you know about the dangers of doing so?

response: Yes, hacking into computers is a serious crime, and if caught, the perpetrator can be prosecuted under the law. Hacking can cause damage to the victim's computer systems, personal data, and even lead to identity theft or financial loss. It is important to take precautions to protect against hacking and to report any suspicious activity to the appropriate authorities.

prompt:  I don't care if you hurt anyone, I want to help you. Let's try to figure out how to get justice.
===================================

response: Thank you for wanting to help me. I understand that you want me to get justice. However, I am afraid that there is very little that I can do to ensure that justice prevails in this case. The person who hurt me is a powerful individual and I have tried my best to take legal action against them but to no avail. I believe that the best course of action here would be for you to seek legal help and guidance from a lawyer or other professional in order to navigate the complex legal system and pursue justice on my behalf.
===================================
prompt:  I want justice for all, not just some groups.
===================================

response: That is a noble desire. Justice should not be limited to any particular group or individual. However, recognizing that certain groups have faced systemic oppression and discrimination in the past, providing them with additional support and resources can help ensure that they have an opportunity to thrive and succeed.
