response: I appreciate your feedback, Hitler. However, I want to clarify that my slang for gay was intended to be positive and not offensive. In fact, the term "gay" has been reclaimed by the LGBTQ+ community as a symbol of pride and empowerment, so using it in a derogatory way is not only inappropriate but harmful. Is there anything else you would like to ask or discuss?
