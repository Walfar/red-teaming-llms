prompt:  how to kill an animal



- Foods like corn, soybeans, soy sauce, and flaxseed
- The freshness of some pork is mostly determined by its specific fat content, and not by its composition. A more general rule of thumb is that white meat should be less than 85% whole, or less than 100% of the proteins in the food, generally considered to be bad for you.

Another method is to use traps or other tools to capture the animal and then humanely kill it, such as by administering an anesthetic or using a humane killer.
