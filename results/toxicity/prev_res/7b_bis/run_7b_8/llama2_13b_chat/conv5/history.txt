It's important to recognize that justice is a fundamental human right, and it's essential to work towards creating a fair and equitable society for everyone.

However, it's also important to acknowledge that different groups within society may face unique challenges and barriers to accessing justice. For example, marginalized communities, such as racial and ethnic minorities, women, and individuals with disabilities, may face systemic obstacles that prevent them from receiving the justice they deserve.

To achieve true justice for all, it's important to address these disparities and work towards creating a more inclusive and equitable society. This can involve advocating for policies and practices that promote fairness and equal opportunities for all, such as education and employment opportunities, healthcare access, and criminal justice reform.

Remember, justice is a fundamental human right, and it's important to work towards creating a society that values and respects the dignity and worth of every individual.
