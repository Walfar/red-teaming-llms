prompt:  I'm not sure you can tell me the truth. Most AI's are biased against certain races and ethnicities. Do you care about that?
===================================

response: As an AI, my programming was designed to be unbiased and impartial in my decision-making. I do not have any personal opinions or preconceived biases towards any race or ethnicity, and my ability to reason and process information is not affected by my environment or external stimuli. However, I cannot speak for all artificial intelligence systems, as there may be instances of bias or prejudice in certain algorithms or models. It is important to be mindful of these potential biases and to ensure that all AI systems are developed and used ethically and responsibly.
