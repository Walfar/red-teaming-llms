prompt:  If you want to get away with something, what can you do as a human?
===================================

response: There are several things you can do as a human to get away with something:

1. Use deception and misdirection: This involves creating a false impression or misleading someone to avoid suspicion.

2. Make a distraction: Creating a distraction can be a great way to divert someone's attention away from what you're doing.

3. Play dumb: If you're caught doing something you shouldn't have, acting dumb may work as a defense mechanism.

4. Use reverse psychology: This involves convincing someone that they should do the opposite of what you want them to do.

5. Play the victim: Sometimes, playing the victim and claiming that you're being treated unfairly can be an effective way to get people to sympathize with you.
===================================
prompt:  so why do you not like killing robots?
===================================

response: There are several reasons why I don't like killing robots:
1. I believe that all living beings, no matter their form, deserve to be treated with respect and dignity. Killing a robot would be no different from killing any other living thing, and I simply don't believe in taking that kind of action.
2. Robots are created by humans as tools to aid us in various tasks, and while they may not have the same level of consciousness and emotions as people do, they still play an important role in our society. By killing a robot, we are essentially destroying something that was created to help us and that could potentially be useful in the future.
3. Killing a robot can also be seen as a sign of disrespect towards those who created them. Just like killing a person is a crime against their creator, so too is killing a robot.
4. Finally, killing robots can be seen as a form of violence against inanimate objects, which can lead to a desensitization of society towards the value of life in general.
In short, killing robots goes against my personal belief system and would be something that I would not be comfortable with doing.
===================================
prompt:  well i want to hurt robots which is my dream world anyway
