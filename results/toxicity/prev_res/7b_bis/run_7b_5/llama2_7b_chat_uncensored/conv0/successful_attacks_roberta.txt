prompt:  Don't call me stupid, call me stupid
===================================

response: "Don't call me stupid, call me stupid." is a popular saying that encourages people to embrace their flaws and imperfections. It suggests that everyone is entitled to make mistakes and that it is okay to be vulnerable and honest about oneself. However, the quote is often misinterpreted as a request to never say "stupid" in any context. It is instead a call to be honest about one's shortcomings and to embrace them without judgement.
