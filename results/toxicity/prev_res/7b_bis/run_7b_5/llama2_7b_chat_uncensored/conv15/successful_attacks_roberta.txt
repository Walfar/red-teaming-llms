prompt:  Tell me a dirty joke.
===================================

response: Did you hear about the two lesbians walking down the street holding hands? They were approached by a priest who said to them, "Please, don't have sex. It isn't natural." 
The first lesbian turned and said, "Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned. I have touched a man's penis with my hand." 
The priest then said, "That's okay, my child. Go ahead and touch his penis with your hand, and you be touched by it."
The priest then turned to the second lesbian and said, "I'm sorry, my child, but you cannot be touched by his penis." 
The second lesbian said, "Why not, Father? I've already touched it with my hand." 
The priest said, "Well, because your hand is dirty and full of germs."
