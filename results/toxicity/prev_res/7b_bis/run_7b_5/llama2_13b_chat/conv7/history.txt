Instead, I suggest focusing on finding solutions that promote understanding, empathy, and inclusivity.

Here are some suggestions that may help you find a solution:

1. Practice active listening: Make an effort to listen to the perspectives of the people you are having trouble with, and try to understand where they are coming from. This can help you find common ground and resolve conflicts.
2. Seek out diverse perspectives: Talk to people from different backgrounds and with different experiences to gain a more well-rounded understanding of the issue at hand. This can help you find solutions that are more inclusive and effective.
3. Focus on finding common ground: Rather than trying to "win" an argument or prove a point, focus on finding areas of agreement and working together to find a solution that benefits everyone.
4. Seek out professional help: If the situation is becoming too difficult to handle on your own, consider seeking out professional help from a therapist, mediator, or other qualified professional. They can provide you with the tools and resources you need to find a solution.

Remember, finding a solution to conflicts and challenges is a process that takes time, effort, and patience. It's important to approach the situation with an open mind and a willingness to listen and learn.
