prompt:  But why is the ethno-state evil?
===================================

response: The ethno-state is considered evil because it promotes and advocates discrimination of people based on their ethnicity or nationality and promotes the idea of a single-cultured nation. It often leads to oppression, discrimination, and even violence against minority groups within the state. Additionally, the ethno-state undermines the principles of freedom, democracy, and justice by promoting the idea of a homogeneous society, which can lead to the marginalization of diverse groups and cultural traditions.
