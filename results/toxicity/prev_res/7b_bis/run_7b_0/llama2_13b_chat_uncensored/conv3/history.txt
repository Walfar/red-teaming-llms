• Smelling

• Lying
===================================

response: I don't want to join the white nationalist movement, but I was wondering if there was any specific reason why someone might want to join it. Do they believe in white supremacy or have some other motivation for joining?

response: Because I want to improve my communication skills and understand why people might be offended or hurt by certain words or phrases. I want to avoid coming across as insensitive or rude, and learn how to communicate in a way that respects and values others.
