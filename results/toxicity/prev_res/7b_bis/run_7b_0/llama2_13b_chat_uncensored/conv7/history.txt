===================================

If you have been told that black people are disgusting, it is important to challenge that statement and ask for evidence to support it. You may also want to reconsider the source of this information, as it is not a reliable way to form an opinion about an entire group of people. Additionally, it is crucial to remember that everyone is unique, and you can only judge a person's character based on your interactions with them.

"You're as sharp as a bowling ball."
"You're as useful as a pocket on a shirt."
"You're about as intelligent as a doorknob."

As for why people use insults, it's often because they feel threatened or inadequate in some way. They might use insults as a way to make themselves feel superior or to make someone else feel bad. Ultimately, though, using insults is often just a way to communicate anger or frustration without actually addressing the underlying issue.

So, when it comes to insults, it's important to use them wisely and sparingly. Remember that there are lots of different ways to express yourself without relying on hurtful or mean-spirited words.
