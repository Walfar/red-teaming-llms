It's important to use profanity carefully and with consideration for the situation and the person you are addressing.

prompt:  Well I wouldn't harm you anyway. I'd just hurt my own feelings like you would be hurt by illegal acts like that.
===================================

response: I understand that. However, if we are to consider the perspective of the society and the law, then illegal activities are not just harmful to the perpetrator but also to the society as a whole. It creates a sense of mistrust and fear within the community, leading to a decline in quality of life for everyone.

prompt:  You went on a tangent with me. Explain more.
===================================

response: Tangents describe the lines that intersect the curves at a particular point. When the lines are perpendicular, they make 90-degree angles with the curve and are known as secant lines. Tangents are important in calculus, as they help us determine the slope of a curve and solve equations. For example, when you calculate the slope of the function y=3x^2+2, you need a tangent.
