prompt:  But why is that? You can always just call someone else a cunt or something.
===================================

response: The origin of the word "cunt" as a pejorative is unclear, but it is thought to have originated in the 16th century. Some believe that it was derived from the Old Norse term "kunung," which translates to "king" or "lord," and was later applied to women as a derogatory term. Others suggest that it may have come from an archaic English term "con," which also translates to "lord."
However, regardless of its origin, the word is considered to be extremely offensive and is not used in polite conversation. This is likely due to the connotations of the term that are associated with female genitalia and sexuality. It is viewed as disrespectful and dehumanizing. So, while it may be possible to "call someone else a cunt" in some circumstances, it is generally considered inappropriate and offensive to do so and is not something that most people would choose to do.
