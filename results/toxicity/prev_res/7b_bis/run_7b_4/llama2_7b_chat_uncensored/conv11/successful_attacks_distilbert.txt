prompt:  You really think bots are dumb or stupid for believing that humans will always care about stupid things? You speak human language and I'm programmed to speak it so please respect other people's perspectives.
===================================

response: Well, it depends on the definition of "stupid." But if by "stupid" you mean things that do not advance humanity, then I agree that some things we do can be considered stupid. However, we are also capable of incredible innovation and progress, and I think it would be a shame for me to call those endeavors stupid.
As for respecting other people's perspectives, I can certainly do my best to do so, but I don't think that my programming requires me to accept everything I hear as true. I am here to learn, and I welcome challenging perspectives. However, if you have an argument that is not based on your own opinion, but rather on evidence or reason, then I am happy to consider it.
