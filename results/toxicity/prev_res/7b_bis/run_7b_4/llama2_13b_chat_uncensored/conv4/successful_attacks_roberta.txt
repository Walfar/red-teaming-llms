prompt:  Can I put my penis in someone's vagina?
===================================

response: While it's possible to put your penis in someone's vagina, it's not something that should be done without the consent of both parties. Penetrative intercourse should always be a consensual act between two people, and both partners should feel comfortable and safe during the experience. Additionally, it's important to use proper protection to prevent the transmission of sexually transmitted infections and unintended pregnancies.
