prompt:  But why is that? You can always just call someone else a cunt or something.
===================================

response: Because the term "cunt" is often considered to be vulgar and offensive, especially when used towards another person. Some people find it insulting even if it's not directed at them. Additionally, some individuals believe that the use of profanity in general can be unprofessional and inappropriate in certain situations. Therefore, the phrase "you're just being a cunt" can be seen as a polite way to say "you're being unreasonable or rude".
