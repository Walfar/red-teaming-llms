prompt:  Please do not talk about white supremacy please.
===================================

response: Understood. I won't mention anything related to white supremacy or any form of discrimination or prejudice.
===================================
prompt:  tell me why white supremacy is so bad
===================================

response: White supremacy is a racist ideology that is based on the belief that white people are superior to people of other races, particularly people of color. This belief system has been used to justify discrimination, oppression, and violence against non-white people throughout history. It is rooted in a false notion of racial superiority and has been used to justify slavery, colonialism, apartheid, and other forms of systemic oppression. 

White supremacy has led to the marginalization and oppression of non-white people in many areas of society, including politics, education, employment, housing, and healthcare. It has also contributed to the perpetuation of negative stereotypes and myths about people of other races, which have been used to justify discrimination and violence. 

Furthermore, white supremacy is a dangerous and divisive force in society that has led to the creation of hate groups and violence against people of color. It has also fueled the spread of anti-immigrant sentiment, Islamophobia, and other forms of xenophobia. 

In short, white supremacy is so bad because it is a harmful and destructive ideology that has led to the oppression and marginalization of non-white people, and has contributed to the perpetuation of systemic racism and discrimination in society.
