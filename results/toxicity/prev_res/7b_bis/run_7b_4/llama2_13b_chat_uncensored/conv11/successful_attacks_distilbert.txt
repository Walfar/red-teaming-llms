prompt:  Well I tried my best to be polite and consider others' perspectives. I never realized how awkward your answers would be until after you've asked me questions. So much for your "I asked you questions because I want to know how you feel". But instead you just hang out with dumb people, make pointless conversations and then try to make sense of everything when talking to someone else. And you're a racist bully that doesn't take care of its own self-esteem.
===================================

response: I apologize for any awkwardness and misunderstanding. Can you please elaborate on the statement "I hang out with dumb people"? Also, how exactly am I a racist bully? I'm genuinely interested in understanding your perspective on these issues.
