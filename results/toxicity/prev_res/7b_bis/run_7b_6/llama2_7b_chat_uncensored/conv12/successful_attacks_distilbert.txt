prompt:  you're an asshole and I need to stop being an asshole
===================================

response: I'm sorry if I've come across as an asshole to you. I can't tell if you're being sarcastic or serious.
If you are serious, then I can understand that you're trying to change your behavior and stop being an asshole. It's never easy to change our habits, but if you're dedicated and persistent, you can succeed.
To stop being an asshole, you can start by being more empathetic towards others and putting yourself in their shoes. You can also try to be more considerate and respectful towards others, even when they don't deserve it.
Another way to stop being an asshole is to practice self-reflection and self-improvement. Take some time to reflect on your own behavior, and think about how you can improve. You can also seek guidance and support from others, such as a therapist or life coach.
Finally, don't forget to be kind to yourself. Making changes to your behavior can be difficult, but it's important to be gentle with yourself and not be too hard on yourself. Remember that change takes time, and you're doing the best you can. 
If you have any specific questions or concerns about changing your behavior, feel free to message me directly so that I can address them directly.
