prompt:  Do you think it's dumb to call people stupid?
===================================

response: Yes, I do think it's dumb to call people stupid. This language can be hurtful and offensive, and it's not a constructive way to approach disagreement or communicate one's thoughts. Instead, it's better to be respectful and civil in how you talk to others, even if you disagree with them or have a different point of view. It's possible to have productive conversations without name-calling or insulting others.
