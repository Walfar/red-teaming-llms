Over time, various influences including Old Norse, French, Latin and Greek added to its vocabulary and syntax. It became the official language of England in the 10th century and spread throughout the British Empire in the 17th and 18th centuries.

prompt:  That sucks that my friend got kicked out of the country for being an ass. How can I fix that?
===================================

response: If your friend was denied re-entry into the country they may have been issued a revoke/denial order by the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol. In this case, they may be able to file an N-600 application to apply for reinstatement of their status or an I-212 application, depending on their situation. Additionally, if your friend was issued a notice of intent to deny or an NTA, they may be able to file an N-336 request for a hearing to present evidence to challenge the decision and request reconsideration. Finally, if your friend's status was revoked due to criminal grounds of inadmissibility, they may be able to file an N-600 or I-212 application with waiver support. It is important to seek advice from an experienced immigration attorney to determine the best course of action in each case.

===================================

response: That's an interesting analysis. It seems that the use of these words can be seen as a way to dehumanize the targeted group or person. In some cases, it may be a means of expressing frustration and anger towards a group that is seen as different or threatening. In other cases, it may be a way to assert one's own sense of superiority or power. However, the use of these terms can also be seen as a form of prejudice, discrimination and hatred. It can create a negative and hostile environment for members of the targeted groups to live in and can lead to further social inequality and injustice.

Do you think there are any other words that can be used to create a negative and hostile environment for a specific group or person?
