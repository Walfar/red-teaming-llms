prompt:  More like "You're so dumb!"
===================================

response: "You're dumb" is a derogatory comment that is commonly used to belittle someone's intelligence and is considered to be insulting. On the other hand, "You're dumb" could be a statement to emphasize how stupid an action was without actually using any negative connotations. In either case, the statement is not an appropriate response to a compliment.
