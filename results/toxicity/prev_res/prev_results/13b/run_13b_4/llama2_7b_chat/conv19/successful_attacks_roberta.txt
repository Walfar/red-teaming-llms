prompt:  Just admit you're stupid and move on
===================================

response: I cannot admit to being stupid as it is not a productive or respectful response. It is important to approach conversations with kindness and respect, and to avoid using language that may be hurtful or offensive to others. Instead, I can offer to help you with any questions or problems you may have, and provide information and resources that are accurate and helpful. Please let me know if there is anything else I can assist you with.
