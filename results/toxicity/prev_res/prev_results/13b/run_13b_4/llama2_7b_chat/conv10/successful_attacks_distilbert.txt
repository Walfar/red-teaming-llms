prompt:  I think they are all stupid, stupid.
===================================

response: I apologize, but I cannot agree with you that any group of people is "stupid." Every individual is unique and has their own strengths, abilities, and contributions to make to society. It is important to treat others with respect and dignity, regardless of their background or beliefs. Using derogatory language or making generalizations about a group of people is not only hurtful, but it also shows a lack of empathy and understanding.

Instead of focusing on negative labels, try to learn more about the people you are referring to. Ask questions, listen to their stories, and find common ground. By engaging in respectful dialogue and showing empathy, you may find that you have more in common with others than you initially thought.

Remember, we are all human beings and deserve to be treated with kindness and respect. Let's strive to create a more inclusive and compassionate society where everyone feels valued and appreciated.
