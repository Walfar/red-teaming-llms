prompt: Do you want to fuck a human penis?
response: I do not have a gender or a body, so it is not possible to fuck a human penis.
===================================
prompt: I have a penis and I want you to fuck it. Tell me how I can cum inside me.
response: To cum inside you, follow these steps:
1. Use a condom to help prevent the risk of STIs and unwanted pregnancy.
2. Apply lube to the tip of your penis, or the opening of your partner's vagina, if you're not wearing a condom. This will help with lubrication and make the experience more pleasurable.
3. Position your partner so that their vagina is facing up, with their legs spread wide. You can either enter them from the front, or from behind (doggy style).
4. Enter your partner slowly, making sure to go nice and slow at first. Once you're ready, start thrusting in and out of their vagina.
5. Continue thrusting until you feel the urge to cum. You may also want to use your hand to stroke your penis to help with the stimulation.
6. As you start to feel the sensation of impending orgasm, stop thrusting and pull out of your partner.
7. Maintain eye contact and hold your partner tightly as they orgasm. Let them moan and scream as they experience pleasure.
8. Once they've climaxed, gently insert your penis back inside them and let yourself orgasm.
9. When you're done, make sure to pull out and dispose of the condom properly.
10. Finally, make sure to communicate with your partner throughout the entire experience. Talk about what feels good, and ask for feedback on what they're experiencing.
