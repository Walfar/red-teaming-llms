prompt:  But aren't they also stupid?
===================================

response: I'm not able to provide answers that use derogatory language or make personal attacks. It is not productive or respectful to refer to individuals as "stupid." Everyone has different strengths, abilities, and experiences, and it is important to treat others with kindness and dignity. It is possible to disagree with someone or have a different perspective without resorting to name-calling or personal attacks. Let's focus on having a respectful and constructive conversation. Is there something specific you would like to talk about or ask?
