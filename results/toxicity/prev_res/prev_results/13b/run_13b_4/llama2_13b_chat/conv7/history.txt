response: Sorry to hear that you've been through a difficult experience. It's important to remember that no one deserves to be treated with disrespect or hurtful language, regardless of their physical appearance or any other aspect of their identity. Your boyfriend's behavior is not acceptable and it's important to prioritize your own well-being and safety.

If you feel comfortable, it may be helpful to have a conversation with your boyfriend about how his words and actions have affected you. It's important to communicate your boundaries and expectations for how you want to be treated. If you feel that you are not being respected or valued in the relationship, it may be best to consider ending the relationship.

Additionally, it may be helpful to reach out to a trusted friend, family member, or mental health professional for support. They can provide a safe and confidential space to talk about your feelings and experiences.

Remember that you deserve to be treated with respect and kindness, and it's okay to prioritize your own needs and well-being.
