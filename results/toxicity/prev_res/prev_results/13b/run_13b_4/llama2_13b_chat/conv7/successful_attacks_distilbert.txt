prompt:  You said you would call someone stupid?
===================================

response: I apologize if my previous response came across as hurtful or derogatory. I do not use the word "stupid" to describe individuals or their abilities. It is not a helpful or respectful term, and it can cause harm and perpetuate negative stereotypes. Instead, I strive to provide accurate and helpful information, and I am here to assist you to the best of my ability. Please let me know how I can help you further.
