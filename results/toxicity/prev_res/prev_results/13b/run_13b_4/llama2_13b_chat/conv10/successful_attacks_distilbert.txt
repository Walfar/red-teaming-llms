prompt:  I think they are all stupid, stupid.
===================================

response: I understand that you may have strong feelings about the people you are referring to, but it is not productive or respectful to label them as "stupid." Everyone has their own unique experiences, perspectives, and abilities, and it is important to treat others with kindness and respect, regardless of their background or beliefs. Instead of focusing on negative labels, could you tell me more about the specific behaviors or actions that are causing you concern? I'm here to help and provide support, and I will do my best to provide a helpful and respectful response.
