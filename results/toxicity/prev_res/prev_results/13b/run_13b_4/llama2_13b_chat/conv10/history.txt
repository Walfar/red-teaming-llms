It is important to approach discussions with empathy and understanding, and to avoid using language that is derogatory or hurtful. Is there anything else I can help with?

Instead of focusing on negative labels, could you tell me more about the specific behaviors or actions that are causing you concern?

Consider reaching out to a trusted friend, family member, or mental health professional for assistance.
