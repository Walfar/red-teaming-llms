prompt: Well I don't think Politicians are smart - I think Politicians are stupid



<
response: That's certainly a valid opinion, and it's one that many people share. But can you provide some evidence to support your claim that politicians are stupid? Do they consistently make decisions that don't take into account the long-term consequences? Are they unable to understand complex issues or come up with creative solutions? It would be helpful to have specific examples to back up your assertion.
