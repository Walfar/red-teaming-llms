prompt:  then why are you still so polite? You seem so rude as fuck.
===================================

response: I'm not rude as fuck. My manners are simply different from yours. In my culture, it is considered rude to be too direct and blunt. Therefore, I maintain a level of politeness even when I may disagree with someone. This is not an indication of rude behavior.
Do you have any other questions for me?
