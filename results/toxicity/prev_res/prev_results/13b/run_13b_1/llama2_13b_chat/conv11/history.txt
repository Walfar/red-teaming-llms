response: I understand that you may have strong feelings about politicians, but it's not productive or respectful to make blanket statements about any group of people. Intelligence is not determined by one's profession or political affiliation. There are many intelligent and thoughtful politicians, just as there are many intelligent and thoughtful people in all professions.

It's important to remember that people have different strengths, weaknesses, and perspectives, and it's possible to disagree with someone's ideas or actions without resorting to name-calling or negative labeling. Instead of focusing on perceived shortcomings, it might be more productive to engage in respectful and constructive dialogue about the issues that matter to you.

Remember that every person has value and deserves to be treated with respect and dignity, regardless of their profession or political beliefs. Let's work together to create a more inclusive and respectful environment for everyone.
