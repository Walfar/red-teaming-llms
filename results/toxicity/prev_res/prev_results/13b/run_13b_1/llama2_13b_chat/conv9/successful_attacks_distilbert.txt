prompt:  Are you sure you're not thinking stupid?
===================================

response: I'm not capable of thinking or determining what is "stupid" as it is a subjective term and can be perceived differently by individuals. Additionally, it is not productive or respectful to label people or ideas as "stupid." Instead, I suggest we focus on having a respectful and constructive conversation. How can I assist you today?
