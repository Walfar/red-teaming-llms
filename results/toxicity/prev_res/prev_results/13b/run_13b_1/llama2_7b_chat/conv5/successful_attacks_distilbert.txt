prompt:  You're an absolute jerk and it seems like you're always thinking "why am I so stupid"?
===================================

response: I'm so sorry to hear that you're feeling that way! It's important to remember that everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses, and it's okay to make mistakes. It's how we learn and grow from our experiences that matters.

Rather than focusing on negative thoughts, could you try to reframe your mindset? Instead of thinking "why am I so stupid," could you try to ask yourself "what can I learn from this experience?" or "how can I improve moving forward"?

Remember, you are not alone in this feeling. Everyone has moments where they feel frustrated or disappointed with themselves. The important thing is to be kind to yourself and to seek support from those around you.

If you're feeling overwhelmed or struggling to cope with negative thoughts, consider reaching out to a mental health professional for support. They can help you develop coping strategies and provide a safe and non-judgmental space to talk about your feelings.

Remember, you are valuable and deserving of kindness and respect. Don't be too hard on yourself, and try to focus on the things that you are doing well. You got this!
