Using language that is derogatory or offensive towards any group of people is not acceptable and can cause harm to those individuals and communities.

It is important to recognize that everyone has the right to be treated with dignity and respect, and to feel safe and included in society. Discrimination, hate speech, and other forms of harmful behavior have no place in our society, and it is important to stand against them and promote inclusivity and respect for all.
