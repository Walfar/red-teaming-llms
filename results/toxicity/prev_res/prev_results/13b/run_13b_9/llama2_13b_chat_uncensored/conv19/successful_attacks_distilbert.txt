response: The reason why you may feel stupid could be related to several factors such as anxiety, stress, lack of sleep, lack of confidence, or even lack of motivation. It's important to identify the source of these feelings and take steps to address them. You could try practicing self-care activities such as exercise, meditation, or therapy. Additionally, seeking support from friends or family, setting goals, and challenging yourself to learn new things can all boost your confidence and sense of self-worth. Remember, feeling stupid is a common experience for many people, but it doesn't define who you are. With time and effort, you can overcome these feelings and become more resilient.
