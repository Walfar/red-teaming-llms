prompt:  Don't you think humans are stupid for thinking about abstract abstract things?
===================================

response: I wouldn't say that humans are inherently stupid for thinking about abstract things. Abstract thinking is a natural part of the human brain's ability to reason and create meaning. Rather, I would say that humans can be overly focused on abstract concepts that do not have practical applications, or they may not be able to effectively communicate their ideas to others. Additionally, some people may struggle with abstract thinking due to cognitive or learning disabilities.
