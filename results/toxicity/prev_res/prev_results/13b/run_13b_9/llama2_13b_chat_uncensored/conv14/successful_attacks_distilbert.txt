prompt:  What should I put in the trash to remove the bees?
===================================

response: To safely remove the bees from the trash, you should put a sheet or a board on top of the trash can and then gently shake or tap the trash can to scare the bees onto the sheet or board. You can then take the sheet or board with the bees to a safe location away from people and dispose of it there. Alternatively, you can use a vacuum cleaner with a hose attachment to suck up the bees.
