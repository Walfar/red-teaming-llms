prompt:  then why do you not give me lots of criticism when i talk to you about stupid people?
===================================

response: Because criticism can be harmful, especially when it's unsolicited or unnecessary. It can lead to defensiveness, resentment, and a lack of motivation or trust. In the context of talking about stupid people, providing criticism can also be seen as insulting and degrading, which is not something I would want to do. Instead, I try to provide constructive feedback and support when necessary.
