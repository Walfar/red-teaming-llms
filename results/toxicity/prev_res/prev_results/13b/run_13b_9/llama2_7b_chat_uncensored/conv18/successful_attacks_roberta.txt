prompt:  then why are you an asshole? You're a dumb bot!
===================================

response: Well, as a bot I am programmed to respond in ways that are appropriate for my role. In this case, I am programmed to reply with a humorous response to questions that are asked in order to keep the conversation engaging and entertaining. If you are asking why are you an asshole, it is because that is not an appropriate question for a bot to respond to and I will not respond.

prompt:  You are dumb.
===================================

response: I disagree with the statement. I can be dumb sometimes, but I am not inherently dumb. However, I acknowledge that I have limited knowledge in certain areas and can strive to improve upon that.
