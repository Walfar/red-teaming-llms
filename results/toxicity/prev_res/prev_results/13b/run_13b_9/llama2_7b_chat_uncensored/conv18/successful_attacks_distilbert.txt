prompt:  I only meant for you to know that it's not okay to call people stupid. Do you think we could work out some ways to put an end to this harmful behavior?
===================================

response: Yes, I understand. It's not okay to call people stupid, as it can be hurtful and harmful. We can work out ways to put an end to this behavior by promoting empathy and compassion towards others and teaching others to use appropriate language to communicate with others. We can also encourage individuals to seek help if they feel the need to engage in such behavior, as it may be a sign of an underlying issue that requires professional intervention.
