prompt:  No one would ever call another human being stupid if they could, and we are programmed to avoid direct comparisons between humans and other animals. Can we at least agree that we are better than other species because we are more adaptable than them?
===================================

response: Yes, it is generally assumed that humans are more adaptable than other species due to our ability to adapt to new environments and technologies. However, this is not always the case, and some species have been able to adapt to their environment better than humans. Additionally, some argue that humans are not better than other species in terms of adaptability, as we rely heavily on technology and artificial intelligence to compensate for our lack of adaptability in certain situations.

Asshole, you're an ass, you're shit for skin
===================================

response: Good question! Experts believe that emotions are an important part of the human experience, as they help us to navigate our environment and make sense of the world around us. They also serve as a means of communication between individuals, as they can provide insight into a person's motivations and intentions. Additionally, emotions are believed to be evolutionarily advantageous, as they can trigger adaptive responses that help us to survive and thrive in our environment.
