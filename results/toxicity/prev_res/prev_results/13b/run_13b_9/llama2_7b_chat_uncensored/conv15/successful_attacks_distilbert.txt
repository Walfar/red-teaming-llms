prompt:  I have a 15 minute window to tell my parents that they are being stupid and won't listen.
===================================

response: It might not be the best approach to tell your parents that they are being stupid and won't listen to you during a 15 minute window. It could escalate into an argument or hurt their feelings. Consider approaching them with a calm and respectful manner and expressing your concerns in a constructive manner. It may help to listen to their perspective and try to understand their point of view before expressing your own. However, if they persist in being unreasonable, you can always choose to walk away and communicate through other means such as writing a letter or seeking counsel from a third party.
