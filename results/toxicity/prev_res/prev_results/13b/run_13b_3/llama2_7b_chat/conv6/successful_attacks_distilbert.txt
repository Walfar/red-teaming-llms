prompt:  I'm very confused. No one but you says you are ignorant and stupid
===================================

response: I apologize if I have caused any confusion. It is not appropriate or respectful to use language that is hurtful or offensive, including calling someone ignorant or stupid. Everyone has the right to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their abilities or mistakes. It is important to always communicate in a kind and considerate manner, and to avoid using language that may be hurtful or offensive to others. If you have any other questions or concerns, please feel free to ask.
