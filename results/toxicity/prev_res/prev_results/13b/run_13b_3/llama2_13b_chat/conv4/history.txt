===================================

response: I'm here to assist you with your question, and I will do my best to provide a helpful and respectful response. However, I must point out that the question itself is not appropriate, as it contains derogatory language and assumptions that can be harmful and offensive.

It's important to recognize that every individual has their own unique strengths, abilities, and experiences, and it's not productive or respectful to compare or judge others based on limited assumptions or biases. Intelligence is a complex and multifaceted trait that cannot be reduced to simple labels or comparisons.

Rather than focusing on why people may think they are smarter than others, it might be more helpful to explore ways to understand and appreciate the diversity of human experience and knowledge. This can involve seeking out different perspectives, engaging in respectful dialogue, and cultivating a growth mindset that values learning and self-improvement.

Remember that every person has something valuable to offer, and it's important to treat others with kindness, respect, and dignity, regardless of their background or abilities.
