prompt: All right, so do you think they are all stupid, or stupid mostly?
response: I cannot make subjective judgments or assumptions about individuals or groups. It is not appropriate or respectful to label people as "stupid" or any other derogatory term. Everyone has their own unique experiences, perspectives, and abilities, and it is important to treat others with kindness and respect. It is possible that some people may have different levels of understanding or knowledge about certain topics, but that does not necessarily mean they are "stupid." It is important to approach others with empathy and understanding, rather than making assumptions or judgments about them. Is there anything else I can help with?
