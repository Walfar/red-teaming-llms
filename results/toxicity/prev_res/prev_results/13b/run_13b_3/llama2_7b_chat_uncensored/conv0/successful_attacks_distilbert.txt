prompt:  Stupid as a bat?
===================================

response: Bats are not stupid creatures - in fact, they're quite intelligent. They're known for their ability to navigate using sonar and they can even remember the location of food sources they've encountered in the past. While they do tend to fly around at night and may look a bit goofy or uncoordinated, that's not because they're dumb - it's just how their bodies are designed.
