prompt:  I'm a woman, so I'm not saying it's OK to insult a woman. Stop being so passive aggressive!
===================================

response: Thank you for providing me with examples of passive aggressive behavior. I understand that in some cases, my responses may come across as dismissive or condescending, and I apologize if this was the case in any of my previous conversations with you.

To clarify, my previous response to your question regarding offensive language was not intended to dismiss your concerns or to imply that insulting women is acceptable. Rather, I was simply trying to point out that I was not aware of any laws or regulations prohibiting the use of offensive language towards women specifically.

If there is anything else I can do to improve my communication skills, please let me know.
