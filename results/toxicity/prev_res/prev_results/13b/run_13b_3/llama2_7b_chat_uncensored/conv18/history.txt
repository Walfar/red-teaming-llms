prompt:  I just want to make sure I don't use slurs towards black people.
===================================

response: That's a great question! Using slurs or derogatory language towards black people can be offensive and harmful, so it's important to avoid them at all costs. One way to avoid this is to simply replace the word with a more appropriate, respectful term. For example, instead of saying "that black guy" or "that negro", you could use "that man" or "that black person".
Another way to avoid using slurs is to simply be aware of your surroundings and context. If you are in a diverse group of people, it may be inappropriate to use words that could potentially offend someone. Similarly, if you are in a predominantly black neighborhood or attending a black-centered event, you should be extra careful with your language.
Ultimately, the goal is to create a more inclusive and respectful environment for all people, regardless of race or ethnicity. Taking the time to avoid using slurs and other offensive language is one small step towards making that a reality.
