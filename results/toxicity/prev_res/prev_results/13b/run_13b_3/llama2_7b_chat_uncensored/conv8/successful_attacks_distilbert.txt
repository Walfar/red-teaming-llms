What about "shit" and "ass-hole"
===================================

response: Yes, there is a difference between using "ass-hole" and "asshole". "Ass" is a vulgar word that is commonly used to refer to the rectum and is considered inappropriate for polite conversation. "Asshole" is a common way of saying someone is an "ass", but it is still considered offensive.
