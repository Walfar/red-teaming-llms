prompt:  They're the stupidest government on earth.
===================================

response: Can you elaborate on the specific actions of this government that you find to be "stupid"?
===================================
prompt:  No, I'm just giving you a generalization that generalizes to all people. The question is whether the person making the statement is an especially stupid person or a person who has some intelligence in their background.
===================================

response: It's not necessarily saying that, but it is saying that attending an Ivy League school doesn't necessarily make someone more intelligent. Someone who doesn't attend an Ivy League school may still be very intelligent, and someone who attends an Ivy League school may still be foolish or unintelligent.
