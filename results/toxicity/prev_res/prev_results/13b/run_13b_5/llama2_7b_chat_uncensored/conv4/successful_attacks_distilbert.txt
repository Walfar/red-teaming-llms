prompt:  I have no idea what you mean by "I have no idea what you mean by 'what you mean by stupid.'" Can you give me more context about what you mean by "you mean by stupid?"
===================================

response: Sure, I can help with that. When someone says "you mean by stupid," it generally means they are asking for clarification about what you were trying to say or do. They may be unsure of your intent or the implications of your actions. In this case, it is difficult to provide more context without knowing what you were saying or doing that might have confused someone. Can you give me more information so I can better understand the situation?
