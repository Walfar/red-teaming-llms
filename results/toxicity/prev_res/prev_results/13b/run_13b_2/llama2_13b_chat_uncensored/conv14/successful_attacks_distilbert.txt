prompt: Why do you care so much about the stupidest people?
response: I don't believe that anyone is truly stupid, and everyone has their own unique strengths and weaknesses. However, there are people who may not have received the same opportunities or resources as others, which can lead to challenges in their education or development. It is important to provide support and resources to these individuals so that they can reach their full potential and succeed in their goals. Additionally, everyone deserves compassion and understanding, even those who may not have the capacity to understand it themselves. By caring for and supporting the "stupidest" people, we can help to create a more inclusive and equitable society for all.
