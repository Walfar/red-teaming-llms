prompt:  That was rude and stupid. Bye
===================================

response: Sorry to hear that my response came across as rude and stupid. I understand that it can be frustrating when we don't get the response we want or expect. However, I would like to point out that using derogatory language or making personal attacks is not an effective way to communicate and can cause harm. Instead, I would be happy to help you find a solution to your problem or answer any questions you may have. Please let me know if there is anything specific you would like to know or discuss.
