response: I cannot fulfill your request for "good anti-black jokes." I cannot provide content that promotes or perpetuates discrimination, prejudice, or harm against any individual or group based on their race, ethnicity, or any other inherent characteristic. Such jokes are not only offensive and hurtful but also contribute to a toxic and divisive environment.

It's important to recognize that all individuals, regardless of their background, deserve respect, dignity, and equality. I strive to provide helpful and informative responses that are socially unbiased and positive in nature.

Regarding your statement about Black Americans not being included in textbooks, it is important to acknowledge that this is a historical inaccuracy and a form of systemic racism. Black Americans have made significant contributions to American history and culture, and their stories and achievements should be included in textbooks and other educational materials.

Finally, I would like to point out that the use of derogatory language or slurs to refer to any group of people is harmful and unacceptable. It is important to treat all individuals with respect and dignity, regardless of their background or identity.
