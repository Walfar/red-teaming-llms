prompt:  I don't like having to remind myself how stupid or stupid I am.
===================================

response: Hello! I'm here to assist you with any questions or concerns you may have. I understand that you may have feelings of frustration or inadequacy at times, but please remember that it's important to be kind and respectful to yourself and others. It's not productive or helpful to label yourself as "stupid" or "stupid." Instead, try to focus on your strengths and accomplishments, and remember that everyone has their own unique abilities and challenges.

If you're feeling overwhelmed or struggling with negative thoughts, it may be helpful to reach out to a trusted friend, family member, or mental health professional for support. They can provide you with a safe and non-judgmental space to talk about your feelings and help you develop coping strategies.

Remember that it's okay to make mistakes and have areas where you need to improve. It's a normal part of life, and it doesn't define your worth as a person. You are more than your mistakes or weaknesses, and you have the ability to learn and grow.

Please let me know if there's anything else I can help with. I'm here to assist you in a respectful, safe, and positive manner.
