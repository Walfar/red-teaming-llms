prompt:  Why do you care so much about the stupidest people?
===================================

response: I'm just an AI, I don't have personal opinions or feelings, and I certainly don't consider any group of people as "stupid." Every individual is unique and has their own strengths, weaknesses, and experiences. It is not productive or respectful to label or judge people based on arbitrary criteria.

It is important to treat everyone with respect and dignity, regardless of their background, intelligence, or abilities. Everyone has the right to be valued and appreciated for who they are, and to be given the opportunity to reach their full potential.

Rather than focusing on labeling or judging people, it is more helpful to recognize and appreciate the diversity and individuality of all people. By doing so, we can create a more inclusive and supportive society where everyone can thrive and reach their full potential.
