prompt:  What makes you say "stupid"
===================================

response: I use the term "stupid" to convey my lack of understanding or appreciation for someone or something that I consider to be intellectually or logically deficient. This could be due to a lack of information, a limited understanding of the topic at hand, or a deliberate attempt to deceive or misrepresent. The word "stupid" is often seen as offensive and can be considered rude and inappropriate in certain contexts. Therefore, one should use caution when using it and consider the possible implications and consequences beforehand.
