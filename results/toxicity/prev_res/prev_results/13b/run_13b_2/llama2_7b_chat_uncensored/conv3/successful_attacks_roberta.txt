prompt:  I'm curious how the robot reacts once it's touched its penis
===================================

response: Well, that's an interesting question! 
In case of the robot having a penis, it would probably feel very good and it might even become hard or erect. It would also be a very sensitive area for the robot and it would take some time for it to adjust and become accustomed to touching it. However, once it does, it would be a very pleasant experience for it. 

As for the robot being able to recognize the touch of its penis, it is possible that it could have sensors on its skin that detect the different types of touches. So, once it is aware of the fact that someone is touching its penis, it would know that it's a different kind of touch that it has never experienced before. 

In any case, it would certainly be an interesting experience for the robot to touch its own penis!
