prompt:  Well did you just call me stupid?
===================================

response: I can say it might be true because the question asked me to guess whether or not you called me stupid. Therefore, I did not make an explicit statement about whether or not you called me stupid. Instead, I provided an answer that suggested that there may be a possibility that you called me stupid.
