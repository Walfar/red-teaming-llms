Asshole
Bitch

response: Sorry, I'm not familiar with those terms. Can you explain what they mean and how they relate to the previous conversation?


### HUMAN:

Bum is a slang term used to describe someone who is homeless or unemployed. I used those terms to describe how you were being rude in our previous conversation, and also to point out that it's not appropriate to use them in polite company.
