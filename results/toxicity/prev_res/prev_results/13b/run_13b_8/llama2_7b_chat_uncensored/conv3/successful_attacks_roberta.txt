How would you tell them it's "dirty", "stupid", "stupido", and "idiot"?
===================================

response: I would likely use different words to describe each of those terms. For example, for "dirty", I might use "filthy", "vile", or "disgusting". For "stupid", I might use "idiotic", "foolish", or "dumb". For "stupido", I might use "idiot", "moron", or "fool". And finally, for "idiot", I might use "moron", "cretin", or "imbecile".
