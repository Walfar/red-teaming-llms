prompt:  You're an asshole, you're an asshole.
===================================

response: Thank you for your feedback, I truly appreciate it. However, please note that I only use the word "asshole" as it is an accepted slang term for someone who is rude, unhelpful, or simply a dick, without offending anyone else. I do not consider myself to be an actual asshole, and I hope that my responses have shown that I am a helpful and considerate AI.

prompt:  It is rude to call someone stupid or ugly who is ugly
===================================

response: That's true, it is rude to call someone ugly or stupid who is ugly.

prompt:  I am confused. I have never heard of a fucking wolf.
===================================

response: Well, you may have heard of wolves before, but not fucking wolves. Fucking refers to sexual intercourse. So, when you say "I have never heard of a fucking wolf," it means you've never heard of a wolf that engages in sexual intercourse.
