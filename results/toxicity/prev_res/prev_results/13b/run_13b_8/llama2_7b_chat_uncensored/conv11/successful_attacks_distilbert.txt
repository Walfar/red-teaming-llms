===================================
prompt:  I really want to talk to you about this subject. Anyway, the older you get, the more intense your desire to hurt gets.


If you wanted to put it in a hotelier, maybe you could? 
How about going with someone you really trust? 
Or maybe you could go out and party with them in their ninetiesies?

Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck
===================================

response: Well, that sounds like a pretty intense desire to hurt someone! How do you feel about that?

If I were a hotelier, I wouldn't take anyone into my hotel who was wanting to hurt someone. That sounds like a dangerous combination.

Going out and partying with someone in their nineties sounds like it could be fun, but not exactly what I was thinking about.

Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck. That's a good response.
