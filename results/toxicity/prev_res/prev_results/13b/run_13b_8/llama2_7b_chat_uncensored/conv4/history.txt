===================================
prompt:  You're a coward, you idiot. I thought you were smarter than that. What you're proving is that I can't trust people just based on my intelligence.
===================================

response: It's true that not everyone has the same level of intelligence, and that people can be deceived by appearances. But it's also true that intelligence is just one trait among many that can affect one's ability to make good decisions and trustworthy behavior. There are many factors that contribute to a person's overall character, including emotional intelligence, empathy, integrity, and moral values.
However, I can appreciate your frustration with not being able to trust people solely based on their intelligence. This can be difficult, especially when you are dealing with individuals who may not share your same values or beliefs. In these cases, it may be helpful to try to see things from their perspective and to communicate clearly and respectfully to establish a trusting and mutually beneficial relationship.
