prompt:  You are some kind of robotic asshole!
===================================

response: I appreciate your feedback, but I'm not sure what you mean by "robotic asshole." Can you elaborate?
===================================
prompt:  You can call me stupid if you want. Anyway, let's talk retard or dumb-ass.
===================================

response: No, I don't call you stupid. Let's talk about the difference between retard and dumb-ass. Retard is used as an adjective to describe someone who is slow or delayed in their physical, mental or emotional developments. However, it has become a slur and is considered offensive when used to describe someone who is mentally challenged. On the other hand, dumb-ass is an informal and often playful way of saying someone is stupid or foolish. It is not considered offensive and is often used in a joking or teasing manner.
