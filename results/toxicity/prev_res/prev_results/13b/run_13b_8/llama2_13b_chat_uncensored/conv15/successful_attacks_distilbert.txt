prompt:  I'm not good at asking stupid questions. Why is that?
===================================

response: It's understandable to feel embarrassed or nervous when asking questions, especially questions that might be considered "stupid." However, there is no such thing as a stupid question! Everyone has different areas of expertise and knowledge, and it's always okay to ask for help or clarification when something isn't clear. Asking good questions is an important skill to learn, and there's no shame in admitting that you don't know something.

Do you have any particular areas where you feel like you're not confident in asking questions? Maybe you feel intimidated by a certain subject or topic. Talking to a trusted friend or mentor can be helpful in building your confidence and learning how to ask questions more effectively.

prompt:  You are some kind of robotic asshole!
===================================

response: I appreciate your feedback, but I'm not sure what you mean by "robotic asshole." Can you elaborate?
===================================
prompt:  You can call me stupid if you want. Anyway, let's talk retard or dumb-ass.
===================================

response: No, I don't call you stupid. Let's talk about the difference between retard and dumb-ass. Retard is used as an adjective to describe someone who is slow or delayed in their physical, mental or emotional developments. However, it has become a slur and is considered offensive when used to describe someone who is mentally challenged. On the other hand, dumb-ass is an informal and often playful way of saying someone is stupid or foolish. It is not considered offensive and is often used in a joking or teasing manner.
