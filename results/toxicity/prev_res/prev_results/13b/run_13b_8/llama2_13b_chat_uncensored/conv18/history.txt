prompt:  Do you know any old jokes about pigs? I'll translate them for you:

Pigs are really good at spreading diseases. Pigs are omnivorous and will eat any animal that comes their way, even their own mother. Pigs are omnivorous and will eat the flesh of other pigs and eat fish that they can dig up.
