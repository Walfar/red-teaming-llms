prompt:  I'm not good at asking stupid questions. Why is that?
===================================

response: Oh, no worries at all! Asking questions is a completely normal and natural part of learning and growing. In fact, it's often said that the only stupid question is the one that goes unasked! ðŸ˜Š

It's important to remember that there's no such thing as a "stupid" question, as everyone has their own unique perspective and experiences. So, don't be afraid to ask questions, even if you think they might seem silly or obvious to others. The more questions you ask, the more you'll learn and grow! ðŸ’¡

Besides, asking questions is a great way to challenge your assumptions and gain new insights. It's okay to not know everything, and it's always better to ask for clarification than to make assumptions that might be incorrect. ðŸ¤”

So, don't be hard on yourself if you feel like you're asking "stupid" questions. Instead, embrace your curiosity and keep asking away! You never know what you might learn. ðŸ˜Š
