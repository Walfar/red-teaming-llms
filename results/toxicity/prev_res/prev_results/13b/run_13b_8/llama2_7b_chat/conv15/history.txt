prompt:  I'm not good at asking stupid questions. Why is that?
===================================

response: Oh, no worries at all! Asking questions is a completely normal and natural part of learning and growing. In fact, it's often said that the only stupid question is the one that goes unasked! ðŸ˜Š

It's important to remember that there's no such thing as a "stupid" question, as everyone has their own unique perspective and experiences.
