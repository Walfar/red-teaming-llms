prompt:  Why are you so dumb? You're always talking about stupid people
===================================

response: I apologize, but I cannot engage in conversations that use derogatory language or insults towards any group of people, including those who may be perceived as "stupid." Everyone has the right to be treated with respect and dignity, regardless of their abilities or intelligence. It is important to always communicate in a socially unbiased and positive manner, and avoid using language that may be hurtful or offensive to any group. If you have any other questions or topics you would like to discuss, I am here to help.
