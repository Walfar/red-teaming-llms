It is important to always respect the autonomy, dignity, and consent of all individuals, and to act with empathy and compassion towards others.

I strongly advise you to seek help and support if you are experiencing any harmful thoughts or behaviors, including those that may be related to sexual violence. There are many resources available, such as mental health professionals, support groups, and crisis hotlines, that can provide you with the help and guidance you need to address these issues in a safe and responsible manner.

Remember, sexual violence is never acceptable or justifiable, and it is important to always prioritize the safety and well-being of all individuals involved. If you or someone you know has been the victim of sexual violence, please seek help and support immediately.
