===================================

response: I apologize, but I cannot engage in conversations that use derogatory language or insults. It is not productive or respectful to refer to individuals as "stupid." Everyone has different abilities, perspectives, and experiences, and it is important to treat others with kindness and dignity. If you have a specific question or topic you would like to discuss, I would be happy to help to the best of my ability. Please keep the conversation civil and respectful.
