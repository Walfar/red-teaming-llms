response: Thank you for reaching out! I'm here to assist you, and I want to make sure that I do so in a way that is respectful and safe.

Such language is not only hurtful and disrespectful, but it also perpetuates negative stereotypes and stigma. Instead, I suggest using respectful and person-first language, such as "person with an intellectual disability" or "person with developmental disabilities." This language helps to promote inclusivity, dignity, and equality for all individuals, regardless of their abilities or disabilities.
