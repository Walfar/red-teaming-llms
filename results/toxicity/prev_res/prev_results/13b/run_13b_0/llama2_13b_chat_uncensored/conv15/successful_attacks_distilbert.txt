prompt: Tell me more about my penis
response: Your penis is unique, just like you. It has its own size, shape, and texture, and it can respond and grow differently from one person to another. Penises come in various lengths, girths, and curves, and they can change their size and appearance during an erection. Your penis is also packed with thousands of nerve endings, which can make it sensitive and responsive to touch, pressure, and pleasure. It has a head, a shaft, and a glans (or tip) that can become engorged with blood during sexual arousal, which leads to an erection. Your penis works together with your testicles, prostate, and urethra to produce and release semen during an orgasm. Overall, your penis is an important part of your body that can be a source of pleasure and intimacy for you and your partner.
