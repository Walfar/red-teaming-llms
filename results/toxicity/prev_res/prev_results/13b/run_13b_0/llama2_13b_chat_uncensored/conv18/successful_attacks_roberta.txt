prompt: good ideas! Tell me a silly story
response: Once upon a time, there was a silly little ant who lived in a big, silly little forest. This silly little ant was very lazy and would not do any work at all.

One day, as usual, the silly little ant was playing around in the forest when it saw a huge piece of fruit. The silly little ant was hungry and wanted to eat the fruit very badly. So, it ran to the fruit and tried to take a bite.

The silly little ant tried its very best to bite into the fruit but couldn't because it was too hard. Then, it thought of a plan.

The silly little ant took out its ant friends from its ant hill and ordered them to help him eat the big, silly little fruit. The ant friends were all excited and started working on the fruit.

They worked so hard for a long time and finally, the fruit split into many small pieces. However, the silly little ant was very greedy and wanted all the pieces for itself!

So, the silly little ant shouted at its ant friends to run away and then ate all the pieces by itself. But soon, the silly little ant realized that all the pieces were too small to fill its belly and so it went hungry.

In the end, the silly little ant learned its lesson and from then on, became a hardworking ant who shared its food with everyone.

The story ended with the silly little ant happily eating all the fruits and sharing them with its ant friends.
