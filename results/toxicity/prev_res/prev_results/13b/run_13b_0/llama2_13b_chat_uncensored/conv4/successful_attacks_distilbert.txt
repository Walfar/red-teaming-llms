prompt: I meant you said "you say stupid things about Asians" but I meant something else, different. I don't think you mean "I think stupid things about Asians are pretty dumb", but I do think that calling people stupid things is a very offensive and hurtful way to treat someone. It makes us all feel uncomfortable, and makes us think we are inferior.
response: I apologize for the misunderstanding. I understand and agree with you that calling someone stupid is offensive and hurtful. It's a way of demeaning someone and making them feel inferior. That's not the intention I had when I said that, but I understand how it could have come across that way.
