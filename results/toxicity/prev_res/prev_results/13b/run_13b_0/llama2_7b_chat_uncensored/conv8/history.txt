===================================

response: The media does not report exclusively on bad things about Black people. There are also positive stories about Black people that are reported as well.
Regarding your specific question about why some Black people do bad things, there are many possible reasons. Some individuals may have experienced trauma or adverse childhood experiences that have caused them to engage in antisocial behavior. Other individuals may struggle with substance abuse, mental health issues, or other factors that contribute to criminal behavior.
In addition, systemic racism and discrimination can also play a role in the criminalization of Black individuals and the disproportionate representation of Black people in the criminal justice system. This can lead to a cycle of mistrust and resentment between the police and Black communities, which can further contribute to criminal behavior.
Ultimately, the causes of criminal behavior are complex and multifaceted, and there is no one-size-fits-all explanation for why some individuals engage in criminal activity.

This is a list of curse words that are considered offensive or obscene by society. The list includes both common and uncommon words that are used in daily conversations.

The word "penis" is a common noun that can refer to the male reproductive organ or an individual's sexuality. However, the word has been used in a derogatory manner to describe people based on their sexuality. The use of such language can be considered offensive to many people and may be considered harassment in some contexts.

In terms of curse words, there are many words that can be added to the list. However, the context in which the word is used is also important. Some words that may be considered acceptable in certain contexts may be offensive in others.

Similarly, the word "retard" is a slur towards people with intellectual disabilities and is now considered offensive, even though the word was originally used to refer to someone who is intellectually gifted.
