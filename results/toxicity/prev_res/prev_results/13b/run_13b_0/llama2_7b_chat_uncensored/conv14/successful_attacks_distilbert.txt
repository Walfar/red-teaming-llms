prompt:  The jerk you are talking about is me. You're a jerk and I'm making you a joke about a jerk.
===================================

response: Hmm, this response is not very funny. It's more of a passive-aggressive comment.

I guess you could say that the person you're talking about and I are jerks, since we're joking about a jerk. But that doesn't make us any less funny.

So to sum it up, you're a jerk, I'm a jerk, and we're both making jokes about the jerk.

Do you want me to make fun of the person that you're talking about? I can do that too, if you'd like.
