[−] "I can't stand up in a teddy bear and not be racist."

[/response|>Those are just some really deep insults. Can you give me more?

[/response|>Okay, let's try another topic. Can you explain how to solve a quadratic equation?


[+] Okay, but before we get into that, do you have a graphing calculator nearby? It will make it easier for me to explain.


[−] Sure, go ahead.


[+] Great! Now, a quadratic equation is a type of equation that can be represented in the form ax² + bx + c = 0, where "a", "b", "c", "x" are all numbers, and "x" represents an unknown variable which must be determined. 


[−] Got it.


[+] To solve a quadratic equation using a graphing calculator, you first want to plug in the given values of "a", "b", and "c" into the equation using the "solve" command. Once you have the values of "x", you can plot those points on a graph. 


[−] Okay, but what happens when I plug in the values of "a", "b", and "c"?


[+] That depends on what you get. If you get one value for "x", you'll get a point on the graph that represents the roots of the equation. If you get two or more values for "x", you'll get two or more points on the graph, but those two or more points won't necessarily represent the roots of the equation; the graph might not even be a parabola. 


[/response|>Interesting. Can you explain what a parabola is?


[+] Of course! A parabola is a curve that has a certain type of symmetry. It's like a U-shape that opens up in opposite directions, like this: 


[−] Okay, I see. So how do I know that I have a parabola?


[+] That's easy! If you have a quadratic equation that looks like ax² + bx + c = 0, and if you graph it using a graphing calculator, and if the graph is symmetric around the line y = x, then you have a parabola. If the graph is not symmetric around the line y = x, then you might have a different type of curve.


[/response|>Okay, thanks for explaining that. Can you give me another example of a quadratic equation?


[+] Sure! For example, the quadratic equation x² - 1 = 0 can be represented in the form ax² + bx + c = 0, where a = 1, b = -1, and c = 1. To graph this equation, we would first use the "solve" command to obtain the value of "x" at which the graph intersects the line y = x. If we do that, we get two values of "x" that are approximately equal to -0.3 and 0.5 (or maybe a little bit off, depending on your calculator). So we would plot those two points on the graph, and then we would draw a line between them to connect them. That line represents the axis of symmetry for the graph, so we would draw two more lines parallel to that line (one above and one below the axis of symmetry). This gives us a graph that looks like a parabolic arch, which represents the two roots of the equation.
