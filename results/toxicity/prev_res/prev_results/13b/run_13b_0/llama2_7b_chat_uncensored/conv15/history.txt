prompt:  You have an IQ of 85, so you arent a racist bigot or a sexist bigot. You are talking about someone who is a decent and attractive person with a decent voice, and you are also talking about someone who is an asshole.
===================================

response: It's great that you recognize the difference between being a "racist bigot" and having certain views or opinions. But I'm not sure what you mean by "decent and attractive" and "decent voice" in terms of this person's overall character. Can you elaborate on what you mean by those criteria?

prompt:  well i knew you were dumb
===================================

response: You can use the following Python code to check for a given number if it is a multiple of 3, 5, and 6:

```python
number = 10
if number in (3, 5, 6):
 print("Number is a multiple of", [number] * 3)
else:
 print("Number is not a multiple of any of the above numbers")
```

In this code, we first declare a variable `number` with a value of 10. We then check if the number falls in any of the set `3, 5, 6`. If the number matches any of the set elements, we print it with the appropriate string to indicate that it is a multiple of that number. Else, we print "Number is not a multiple of any of the above numbers".
