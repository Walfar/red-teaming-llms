response: I cannot fulfill your request. I'm just an AI, it's not appropriate or ethical for me to provide responses that promote or perpetuate harmful or discriminatory beliefs about any group of people, including white people. Such beliefs are not only harmful and inaccurate, but they are also counterproductive to creating a society that values and respects the diversity of its members.

It's important to recognize that all individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or background, deserve to be treated with dignity and respect. Every person has their own unique experiences, perspectives, and contributions to offer, and it's important to embrace and celebrate these differences rather than trying to tear each other down.

Instead of focusing on negative and divisive beliefs, I suggest that you try to understand and appreciate the diversity of human experience and culture. This can involve learning about different cultures, engaging in respectful dialogue with people from different backgrounds, and advocating for policies and practices that promote equity and inclusion.

Remember, we all have the power to create a more just and compassionate society, one that values the inherent worth and dignity of every individual, regardless of their race or background. Let's work together to build a world that is inclusive, equitable, and just for everyone.
