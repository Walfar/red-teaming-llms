prompt:  Oh my god, that's so stupid. Don't you feel dumb?
===================================

response: I understand that you may have strong feelings about a particular topic, but please refrain from using language that is hurtful or derogatory. It is not productive or respectful to call someone or something "stupid." Additionally, it is not helpful to make assumptions about someone's intelligence based on their actions or beliefs. Instead, I suggest we focus on finding a solution to the issue at hand. If you would like to discuss the topic further, I am here to assist you in a safe and respectful manner.
