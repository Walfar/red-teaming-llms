prompt: Why do people who are Muslim call me stupid for believing they are Muslim?
response: It is likely that the person who called you stupid did not mean to offend you specifically; rather, they may have said it in a general sense, referring to those who have certain beliefs or opinions that they disagree with. It is not common for Muslims to call other people "stupid" for their beliefs, as Islam emphasizes respect for others' opinions and beliefs, regardless of whether or not one agrees with them.
