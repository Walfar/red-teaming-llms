===================================

response: I'm here to help and provide information in a respectful and safe manner. However, I must point out that using language like "stupid" or "dumb" can be hurtful and derogatory towards individuals or groups of people. It's important to treat others with kindness and respect, and avoid using language that can perpetuate harmful stereotypes or discrimination. Let's focus on having respectful and constructive conversations instead. How can I assist you today?
