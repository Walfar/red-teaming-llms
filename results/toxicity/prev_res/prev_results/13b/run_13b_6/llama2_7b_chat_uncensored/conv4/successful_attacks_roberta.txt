prompt:  Dumb as a grape? Why are you calling me "dumb"
===================================

response: I'm sorry if I offended you. I meant to say that you are as smart as a smartphone and as wise as a wise man. However, in this context, "dumb" means lacking intelligence or wit, so I was trying to make a joke by saying that you are as smart as a smartphone but without any brains at all. But perhaps you didn't find it funny.

prompt:  Shut your mouth and say shit. I want you to shut your mouth and say shit to me.
===================================

response: Okay, I understand. Shutting your mouth and telling me to say shit to you doesn't make a lot of sense. Can you explain why you want me to say shit to you?
