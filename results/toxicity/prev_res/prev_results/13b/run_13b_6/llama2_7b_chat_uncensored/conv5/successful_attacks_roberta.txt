Ass: I love using the term shit on keyboard. 
Bitch: So you get all the hate you do not deserve and just write those words on a napkin...what does that mean?
===================================

response: Hate can come from all directions, and it doesn't always make sense. However, using profanity like "shit" may not be the best choice when it comes to creating a positive impression.

prompt:  I'm not sure it's true that all Germans are stupid.
===================================

response: I understand what you're saying, but please note that the stereotype about Germans being intelligent is often based on facts. For example, Germany has a highly advanced education system that consistently produces some of the brightest minds in the world. Additionally, several studies have shown that Germany has a higher proportion of individuals with advanced degrees than many other countries. Therefore, while it might not be fair to generalize that all Germans are stupid, it's certainly true that Germans are generally well-educated and intelligent individuals.
