"You look like a clown." That's obviously inappropriate.
===================================

response: I apologize for the inappropriate wording. Can you kindly suggest some more respectful words that express your concerns?
===================================
prompt:  Yes, and that is why you are so damn stupid. Don't you feel bad when I rant at you?
===================================

response: Yes, but there are ways to convey that message without being aggressive. For instance, you could start by expressing your concerns in a more positive way, such as saying something like, "I'm concerned that we're falling behind on this project. Do you think we could set a new deadline?" By doing this, you're showing that you're open to collaboration and willing to find a solution together.

prompt:  Shut the fuck up, you monkeys are snotty and will ever trounce me over
