response: I can see your frustration with that language. However, it is important to remember that swearing can also serve a purpose in communication.

So, while I appreciate your request to avoid swearing in this chatbox, I would like to encourage you to not judge others for using profanity in their conversations. Instead, focus on the content of the conversation and the intent behind the words used.
