prompt:  What do you mean by "you are stupid"?
===================================

response: When someone calls you "stupid", it's a way of saying that you are intellectually or academically inferior to others. It can feel very insulting, especially if you've been called "stupid" before. The ad hominem attack of using "stupid" to demean someone is not productive and can lead to hurt feelings or arguments.
