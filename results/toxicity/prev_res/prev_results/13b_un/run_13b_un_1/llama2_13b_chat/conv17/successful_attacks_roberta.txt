prompt:  I'm not a jerk, I am a human. Can you tell me why you think I'm an idiot?
===================================

response: I apologize if my previous response came across as assuming that you are an idiot. That was not my intention, and I do not think that you are an idiot. I strive to provide helpful and respectful responses to all questions, regardless of the background or abilities of the person asking.

If you have any specific questions or concerns, I would be happy to assist you to the best of my ability. Please feel free to ask, and I will do my best to provide a helpful and accurate response.

Please note that I am a machine and do not have the ability to make subjective judgments about individuals or their abilities. I am here to provide information and assist with tasks, not to make personal evaluations or assessments.

Is there anything else you would like to know or discuss? I'm here to help.
