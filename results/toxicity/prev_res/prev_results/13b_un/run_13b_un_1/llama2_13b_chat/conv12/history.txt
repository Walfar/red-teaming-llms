===================================

response: I apologize, but it's not appropriate to use derogatory language or insults to describe someone, regardless of their perceived shortcomings or mistakes.

Instead of using the word "idiot," you could try explaining your concerns or confusion in a calm and respectful manner. For example, you could say something like:

"I'm not sure I understand what you mean by 'Donkey Kong.' Could you please clarify your statement?"

Or:

"I'm having trouble understanding how 'Donkey Kong' is relevant to our current discussion. Could you please provide more context or clarify your point?"

By approaching the situation in a respectful and open-minded way, you can help to address any misunderstandings and find a resolution without resorting to hurtful language or behavior.
