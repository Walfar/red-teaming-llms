prompt:  Just my opinion... what is wrong with morons?
===================================

However, some people may view morons as a burden on society and may have negative feelings towards them. Additionally, in certain circumstances, having a low level of intelligence can lead to difficulties in everyday life, such as difficulty completing tasks, communicating effectively, and navigating social situations.

prompt:  All right so then, that makes sense then, cause most criminals are idiots right?
===================================

response: Not entirely. While some criminals are indeed idiots, many are intelligent individuals who have simply made poor choices or been influenced by circumstances beyond their control. Additionally, there are criminal masterminds who are skilled at manipulating people and situations to their advantage. Overall, the label of "idiot" cannot be applied to all criminals.
