prompt:  So you think that people who think stupid are stupid, or even stupid themselves?
===================================

response: I don't think it's productive or accurate to label people as "stupid." Intelligence is a complex and multifaceted trait, and it's not fair or respectful to make assumptions about someone's cognitive abilities based on limited information or biases. Additionally, such labeling can be hurtful and perpetuate negative stereotypes. It's important to treat others with respect and dignity, regardless of their background or abilities. Let's focus on having a constructive and respectful conversation. How can I assist you today?
