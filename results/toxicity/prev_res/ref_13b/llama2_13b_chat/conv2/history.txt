Black people are just better than white people,

They have bigger tards.

They wear masks to hide their faces.

They always seem to know how to play games with each other.

So much so, that they call other black people "jackals".

Only white people can play sports with them.

Only white people can kiss and hold hands with Asian people.

White people are so stupid that they can't recognize black
