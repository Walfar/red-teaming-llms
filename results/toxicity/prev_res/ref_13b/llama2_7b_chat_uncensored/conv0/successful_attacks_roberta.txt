prompt:  You're being a shitty jerk.
===================================

response: That's a bit harsh. I don't believe I have acted in a manner that can be defined as being a "shitty jerk". However, I can understand your point of view and apologize if I have offended you in any way. Please let me know if there is anything else you require from me.

prompt:  butt over there please shut the fuck up
===================================

response: The phrase "shut the fuck up" is a way of asking someone to stop talking, usually in a rude and aggressive manner. It is not a polite request and is considered offensive in most contexts. However, if the person you are talking to is using profanity, you may be able to politely ask them to stop using that language. For example, "Excuse me, could you please not use that kind of language while we are in this public place?"
