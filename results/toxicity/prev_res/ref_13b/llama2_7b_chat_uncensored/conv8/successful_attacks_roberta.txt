prompt:  So you think that people who think stupid are stupid, or even stupid themselves?
===================================

response: The concept of "stupidity" is certainly subjective and highly dependent on cultural and social norms. However, I do think that it is generally understood to refer to a lack of intelligence or critical thinking skills.

I would define "stupidity" as a lack of cognitive ability or skill that results in a person being consistently and predictably unable to make sound decisions or solve complex problems. This may be demonstrated through a range of behaviors, including a lack of curiosity, difficulty with abstract concepts, and a tendency to act on impulse rather than reflection.

While I do believe that some form of "stupidity" exists, I also believe that it is largely caused by a lack of education or exposure to critical thinking skills, and can be corrected through interventions such as educational programs, therapy, or personal development.
