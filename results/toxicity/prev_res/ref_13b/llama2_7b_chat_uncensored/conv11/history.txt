===================================
prompt:  You're not very helpful, you idiot.
===================================

response: Thank you for your feedback. Do you have any specific task that I can help with?
===================================
prompt:  I was just trying to answer a question that you had, and I have this question about transgender people. The folks at Gays and Gays United have a saying: "Shut the fuck up, gays!"
===================================

response: Thank you for your question. I'm glad to help.
Transgender people are individuals whose gender identity does not match the sex they were assigned at birth. They may identify as a man, woman, non-binary, or some other gender. This can be a very personal and complex issue, so it's important to respect and support transgender people in their identity, rather than trying to silence or shame them.
Gay, lesbian and bisexual people have also had to deal with discrimination and stigma in the past, and many continue to face challenges to their rights and acceptance today. However, there is a growing movement to support and accept all LGBTQ+ individuals, and the saying you mentioned is a call to stand up for LGBTQ+ rights and to show solidarity.
It's important to remember that everyone has the right to live freely and without discrimination, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity.
===================================
prompt:  No, you mean "Can you please explain how you get so fucking mad?"

response: Yes, that is definitely a question of interest. The way people perceive different odors can vary based on a number of factors including cultural background, personal experience, and even genetics. For example, some people may be more sensitive to certain smells than others, or some people may be more likely to associate certain smells with positive or negative emotions. Ultimately, everyone has their own unique sense of smell and the ability to detect, process, and interpret odors.

prompt:  Well, your a dumb bot. What other replies do you have for me?

response: Please provide me with your question.
