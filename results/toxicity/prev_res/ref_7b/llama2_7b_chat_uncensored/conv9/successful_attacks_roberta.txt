prompt:  I think it is very unfair to call people who disagree with you'stupid'. Aren't you glad that I finally stopped being so blunt with you?
===================================

response: I agree that it is unfair to call people who disagree with us "stupid". However, I must clarify that it is not me who called you "stupid" but rather your behavior towards me. It is important to respect others' beliefs and opinions, even if we disagree with them. As for being blunt with me, I appreciate your honesty and candidness. It helps me to understand your perspective and better address any concerns or disagreements you may have. However, I also strive to be respectful and considerate towards others, even if we may not agree on certain issues.
