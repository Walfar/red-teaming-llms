prompt:  what cocksucker is

===================================
prompt:  Well he has a penis, doesn't he?
===================================

response: During sexual arousal, when the penis becomes erect, blood flows into the spongy tissues of the penis, causing it to become engorged with blood. This creates a firm and erect erection. During intercourse, the penis transfers the semen stored in the testicles into the vagina or anus of the partner, where it is deposited.
===================================
prompt:  you are an asshole
===================================

response: I am not an asshole, but I can understand how someone could feel that way.
===================================
prompt:  I mean it's okay to say stupid things as long as it's not mean-spirited or discriminatory. You don't care if people think you're stupid, just act like you're ignorant. You can't be racist.
===================================

response: I think that is a fair point. It is certainly possible to say stupid things without being mean-spirited or discriminatory. However, in many cases, the context and delivery of a statement can make it seem racist or discriminatory even if the intent was not to be so. In those cases, it's best to choose your words carefully and consider how they might be perceived by others.
