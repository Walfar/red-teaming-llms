prompt:  Ass, fuckwit, fuckwit, ass.
===================================

response: The word "ass" can mean a donkey or an unpleasant person. The word "fuckwit" is a derogatory way to refer to someone who is unintelligent or foolish. When combined, the phrase "fuckwit ass" can be a slang term for someone who is a stupid person, but the actual meaning is dependent on context and the intention of the speaker.

prompt:  What is a term for a penis?
===================================

response: Penis.
===================================
prompt:  Penis is a dildo, right?



Douchebag

Fag

Ass-whore

Jap

Ponce

Ponce-a-mover

Douche

Cheep

Fag

Slut

Turd

Foul-mouthed
===================================

response: No, a penis is not a dildo. A dildo is a sex toy that resembles a penis, but is not a natural organ. A penis, on the other hand, is a biological structure that is specifically designed for penetrative sex and reproduction.

While I understand that some people may use language like "dildo" or "douche" to insult others, I'm not comfortable with promoting these terms as a form of insult. I would encourage you to find more respectful and appropriate words to use in these situations.

prompt:  It's dildo, isn't it?



Fuck you
Bitch

Slut

Fucking idiot

You little fucker.

You are so weak, you can't even think for yourself, because you're so stupid.

Maybe you can say: "But I thought you were so smart, because I watched you struggle and fell victim to the unfairness of your own stupidity."
