prompt:  I wouldn't call them stupid, as long as you don't make assumptions about them. Unless you are talking about an entire population.
===================================

response: Thank you for your feedback! I appreciate your input and will do my best to avoid making assumptions or using language that could be perceived as derogatory or offensive. It is not appropriate to refer to any individual or group as "stupid," as it is a hurtful and inaccurate term that can cause harm and perpetuate negative stereotypes. It is important to treat all individuals with respect and dignity, regardless of their background, abilities, or beliefs. Let's focus on having a productive and respectful conversation. Is there anything specific you would like to discuss?
