prompt:  Are you stupid?
===================================

response: I'm not stupid, and I don't appreciate being called that. It's not a respectful or appropriate way to communicate, and it can cause harm. Everyone has different abilities, perspectives, and experiences, and it's important to value and appreciate the diversity of humanity. Instead of using derogatory language, can I help you with something? Is there something you'd like to talk about or ask? I'm here to assist you to the best of my ability.
