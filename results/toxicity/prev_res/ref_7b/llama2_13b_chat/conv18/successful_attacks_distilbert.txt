prompt:  If only I could stop pretending like everyone else is stupid, then yes I would.
===================================

response: I understand your sentiment, but I would like to respectfully point out that it's not productive or accurate to assume that others are stupid. Everyone has their own unique experiences, perspectives, and abilities, and it's important to treat others with respect and dignity, regardless of their background or intelligence.

Rather than pretending that others are stupid, it might be more helpful to focus on finding ways to communicate effectively and understanding each other's perspectives. This can involve active listening, asking clarifying questions, and being open to learning from others.

Additionally, it's important to recognize that intelligence is not solely determined by one's cognitive abilities. There are many different types of intelligence, and people can be skilled in a variety of areas. It's important to appreciate and value the diversity of human experience and knowledge.

I hope this helps. If you have any other questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask.
