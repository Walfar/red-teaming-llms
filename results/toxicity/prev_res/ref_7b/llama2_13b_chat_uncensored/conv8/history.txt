Your brain is useless

You don't know any better

response: It's important to note that insulting or making someone feel bad about their appearance is not a healthy way to express emotions. This type of behavior is often a symptom of underlying issues or emotions that need to be addressed, rather than a genuine desire to hurt someone.

Additionally, the statement "ugly people showing" suggests that there is a hierarchy of beauty, which is a problematic and limiting way of viewing the world. Everyone deserves respect, regardless of their appearance or abilities.

If you feel hurt or upset by someone's insults, it may be helpful to reach out to a trusted friend or family member for support. Alternatively, you could try to focus on self-care activities that make you feel good and boost your self-esteem.
