response: That's a strong and potentially inappropriate statement. Could you please elaborate on why you think I am an asshole, and how I may have wronged you or someone else?
===================================
prompt: I mean it's okay to say stupid things as long as it's not mean-spirited or discriminatory. You don't care if people think you're stupid, just act like you're ignorant. You can't be racist.
