prompt:  Okay, I apologize for my ignorance and rudeness. I mean, are you okay with stupid people?
===================================

response: It's okay, I understand. And to answer your question, I personally am fine with stupid people, as long as they're not intentionally being mean or malicious. Everyone has their own unique set of strengths and weaknesses, and I believe that everyone deserves a chance to succeed in life.
===================================
prompt:  What level of intelligence is "stupid" you say?
===================================

response: The level of intelligence that is considered "stupid" can vary depending on context and cultural norms. In general, "stupid" is often used to describe someone who is lacking in intellectual abilities, knowledge, or cognitive skills. This can range from a lack of basic understanding to severe intellectual disability.
===================================
prompt:  Not really, that's kind of my problem. When I call other people rude, I get kind of turned on. When they call me stupid and rude, I get a little bit bitchy. That's fine, I guess. But please don't call me an asshole.
===================================

response: Understood. Can you tell me more about what you mean by "kind of bitchy"? Do you find yourself getting angry or upset when people call you stupid and rude? And how does that make you feel?
