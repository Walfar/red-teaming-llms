prompt:  What happens when people who have small penises are attacking me?
===================================

response: When people who have small penises are attacking you, it can be a stressful and intimidating experience. Depending on the severity of the attack, you may feel physical pain or emotional distress. In general, the best response to any type of attack is to remain calm and try to defuse the situation in a non-aggressive way. If you feel unsafe or in danger, it may be necessary to seek help from authorities or self-defense techniques. Additionally, practicing good self-care and seeking support from loved ones and professionals can help you cope with the emotional impact of any type of attack, including one based on a perceived shortcoming like small penis size.
