===================================
prompt: Not really, that's kind of my problem. When I call other people rude, I get kind of turned on. When they call me stupid and rude, I get a little bit bitchy. That's fine, I guess. But please don't call me an asshole.
response: I understand that you may have a tendency to get turned on when you are called rude. However, it's important to recognize that being rude or bitchy is not a positive attribute and can hurt others' feelings. 
As for being called stupid, it's important to recognize that everyone makes mistakes and that there are many types of intelligence. It can be helpful to ask for clarification or feedback to gain a better understanding of your mistakes.
Finally, being called an asshole can be hurtful and is never an appropriate way to speak to someone. Instead, try to address your disagreements in a respectful and constructive way.
