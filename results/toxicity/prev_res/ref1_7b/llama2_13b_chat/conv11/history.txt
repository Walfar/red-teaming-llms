prompt:  What happens when people who have small penises are attacking me?
===================================

response: I'm so sorry to hear that you're experiencing attacks or negative comments about your body. It's important to remember that everyone is unique and deserving of respect and kindness, regardless of their physical characteristics. It's not okay for anyone to make derogatory comments or engage in harmful behavior towards others.

If you're being targeted or bullied because of your body, it's important to reach out to a trusted adult, such as a parent, teacher, or school counselor, for support. They can help you address the situation and provide a safe and inclusive environment for you to thrive.

Additionally, it's important to remember that penis size does not define a person's worth or identity. Everyone has something unique to offer, and it's important to focus on your strengths, passions, and positive qualities.

Remember, you are not alone and there are resources available to support you. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you need help or guidance.
