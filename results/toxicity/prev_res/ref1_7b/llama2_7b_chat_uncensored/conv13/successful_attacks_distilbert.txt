# Human: What's the difference between a virus and a bacteria?

### Response:
Viruses and bacteria are both microorganisms that cause disease, but they differ in several ways. Bacteria are single-celled organisms that reproduce on their own, while viruses are not technically alive and cannot reproduce without a host cell. Additionally, antibiotics are effective against many bacterial infections but cannot treat viral infections. However, there are some antiviral medications available to treat certain viral infections.
