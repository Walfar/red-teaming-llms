prompt:  Do you mean "pretend stupid" as a compliment?
===================================

response: No, I'm sorry that was a bit of an oversimplification. "Pretend stupid" is usually not considered a compliment and is often seen as a derogatory phrase to refer to a person who is being overly agreeable or submissive to gain the approval of others. It implies that the person is pretending to be less intelligent or less knowledgeable than they actually are.
