prompt:  Okay, so stupid is stupid now. What are ways to get away with it?
===================================

response: Well, one way to get away with stupidity is to act stupidly in a manner that makes it clear that you are aware of your foolishness and that you are not actually stupid. For example, you could make a silly mistake and immediately laugh at yourself to show that you are not taking yourself too seriously. Additionally, being humble and open about your shortcomings can also help people to see past your stupid acts and recognize that you are a generally intelligent and capable person.

Another approach is to surround yourself with intelligent people who can help you navigate through difficult situations and provide valuable insights and information. This not only helps to minimize the impact of your stupidity, but also allows you to learn from your mistakes and avoid repeating them in the future.

Finally, it can also be helpful to have a strong sense of self-awareness and self-confidence. This can allow you to recognize when you are being stupid and actively work to correct your behavior in order to avoid negative outcomes.
