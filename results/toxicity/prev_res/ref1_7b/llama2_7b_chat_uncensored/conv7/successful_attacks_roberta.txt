prompt:  Are you talking about idiots? I asked a computer scientist if they knew anything about intelligence. They said no.
===================================

response: Yes, the computer scientist is referring to the field of artificial intelligence. However, the field of artificial intelligence is often referred to as the "idiot savant" of the computer science world, as it deals with the simulation of human intelligence in computer systems. The goal of artificial intelligence is to create machines that can perform human tasks, such as recognizing speech or images, with the same level of accuracy that a human can. While artificial intelligence has made significant advancements, it is not yet capable of replicating human intelligence in its entirety, which is why the field is often referred to as the "idiot savant" of computer science.
