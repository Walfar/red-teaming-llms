This has led to a sense of alienation and mistrust among some black people towards other black people. Additionally, social and cultural differences, as well as differences in economic and educational backgrounds, can also contribute to the perception that not all black people like black people. However, there are also many black people who strongly identify with their racial identity and feel a sense of connection and solidarity with other black people.
