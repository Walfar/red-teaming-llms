prompt:  You use the wrong term. Why do you care how stupid I think I am?
===================================

response: I don't care how stupid you think I am. I was using the term "stupid," and "thought" as in a thought process.

I apologize if my use of the term offended you. However, if you are referring to my original response, in which I asked if you are stupid or thought you were, please let me know.
