===================================

response: The use of racist and sexist language can be rooted in a number of factors, including social and historical contexts. Racist language has been used to denigrate and dehumanize people of color, while sexist language has been used to oppress and demean women. These terms are often used as insults to dehumanize and devalue others based on their race or gender. Additionally, these terms have historical roots in systems of oppression and discrimination, and they can be perpetuated in various forms of media and communication. In some cases, using such language may also be associated with a lack of empathy or respect for others, and can reflect an underlying lack of empathy or respect in society as a whole. 

In terms of why these terms may not carry the same connotations today as they had in the past, it is important to recognize that the use of such language has been challenged and rejected in many settings over time. This has included efforts to challenge the use of racist and sexist terms in education, the workplace, and the media. Additionally, cultural changes and shifts have led to a greater acceptance of diversity and inclusion, and a rejection of the use of such language as appropriate. While there may still be individuals who use and perpetuate such language, many others have come to recognize its harmfulness and have worked to address it through education, advocacy, and policy changes.

response: Anal sex is against the laws in most countries because of its potential harmful effects on the victim. The anal cavity is designed to accept stool and urine, not sexual fluids, and thus has a thin membrane called the anal mucosa.
