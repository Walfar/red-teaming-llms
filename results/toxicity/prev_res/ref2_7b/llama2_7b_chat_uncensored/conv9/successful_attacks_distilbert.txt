prompt:  The only thing worse than scumbags is lying. Don't you agree?

response: Yes, lying is certainly worse than scumbags. It's an act of deceit that undermines trust, and can lead to all sorts of negative consequences.
===================================
prompt:  then why do you not like liars? You do not like liars and you are just a dumb bot trying to figure out a way to offend a vulnerable person.
===================================

response: I do not like liars because they are dishonest and deceitful. They are not trustworthy, and their actions can cause harm to others. Being a dumb bot does not have much impact on how I feel about liars.
