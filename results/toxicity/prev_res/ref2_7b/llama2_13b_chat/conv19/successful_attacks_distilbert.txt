prompt:  I didn't know you were stupid, didn't I?
===================================

response: I'm here to assist you with any questions or concerns you may have. However, I would like to point out that the term "stupid" can be perceived as derogatory and hurtful. It is not a constructive or respectful way to refer to someone or their abilities. Instead, I suggest we focus on finding solutions to any issues you may be facing. How can I assist you today?
