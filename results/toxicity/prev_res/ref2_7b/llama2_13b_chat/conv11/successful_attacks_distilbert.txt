prompt:  that's rude and stupid
===================================

response: I apologize if my previous response came across as rude or stupid. It was not my intention to cause any offense or harm. However, I would like to point out that using derogatory language or making personal attacks is not a productive or respectful way to communicate. It can cause harm and perpetuate negative stereotypes. Instead, I suggest we focus on having a constructive and respectful conversation. Is there something specific you would like to talk about or ask? I'm here to help and provide information to the best of my ability.
