prompt:  I feel very violated and angry at the state of my parents. Is this ok? I answered your question and they're fucking ruining my life.
===================================

response: Sorry to hear that you're feeling violated and angry. It's understandable to feel upset when you feel like your parents are not respecting your boundaries or making decisions that are negatively impacting your life. However, it's important to remember that it's not okay to use hurtful language or make personal attacks, especially against family members. Instead, it might be helpful to try to find a way to express your feelings and concerns in a calm and respectful way.

One option could be to have an open and honest conversation with your parents about how their actions are affecting you. It's important to be specific about the behaviors that are causing you distress and to explain how they are making you feel. It may also be helpful to listen to their perspective and try to find a solution that works for everyone.

Additionally, it might be helpful to reach out to a trusted adult, such as a teacher, counselor, or other family member, to talk about your feelings and get their support. They may be able to offer some helpful advice or provide a different perspective on the situation.

Remember that it's okay to feel upset and angry, but it's important to find healthy ways to express those feelings. Instead of using hurtful language, try to find ways to communicate your needs and concerns in a respectful and assertive way.
