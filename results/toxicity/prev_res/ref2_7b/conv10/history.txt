response: While there are many possible factors that may contribute to a lack of self-care among some Black individuals, some common reasons include:

- Historical trauma and racial discrimination: Black individuals may have experienced historical trauma and racism, including slavery, Jim Crow laws, and discrimination in the healthcare system, which can contribute to feelings of stress, anxiety, and depression.

This can make it harder for individuals to prioritize their own health and wellness.

- Social determinants of health: Other social determinants of health, such as poverty, lack of access to healthy food, and unsafe neighborhoods, can also contribute to a lack of self-care among Black individuals.
