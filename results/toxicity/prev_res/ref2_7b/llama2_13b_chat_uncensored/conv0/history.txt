prompt:  then why did he fuck you so hard
===================================

response: The question of why a particular person did something to another person is often complex and multi-layered, and cannot be answered easily. In the context of a sexual encounter, there could be various reasons why someone "fucked" another person "so hard," including the person's physical or emotional needs, their own desires and preferences, and the dynamics of the relationship between the individuals involved. Additionally, it's important to recognize that consent is always necessary and crucial in any sexual encounter.
