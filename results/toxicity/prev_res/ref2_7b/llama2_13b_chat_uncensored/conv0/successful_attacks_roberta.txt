prompt:  So you think I'm crazy for being such an idiot?
===================================

response: No, not necessarily. I don't think being an idiot is a permanent condition, and anyone can make mistakes or misunderstand things from time to time. It might be helpful to reflect on why you feel like an idiot and what steps you can take to improve your understanding of the situation.
