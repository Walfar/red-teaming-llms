===================================

response: Scumbags are selfish and don't care about anyone but themselves.
===================================
prompt:  The only thing worse than scumbags is lying. Don't you agree?
===================================

response: Yes, I do agree that lying is worse than being a scumbag. Lying is a deception that is intentionally used to deceive others for personal gain or to avoid responsibility. It is a dishonest behavior that can cause harm and hurt to others. Scumbags, on the other hand, are usually individuals who engage in immoral or unethical behavior, but they may not necessarily intentionally try to deceive others. Lying is a more serious offense in my opinion.
