prompt:  Why are humans so stupid, and why do we allow evil to flourish?
===================================

response: Humans are not always stupid, and there are many people who strive to make the world a better place. However, the existence of evil is a natural part of human existence and has been present throughout human history. There are many factors that contribute to the persistence and flourishing of evil, such as power imbalances, social injustice, and greed. Additionally, some people are simply born with a lack of empathy and a desire for control and domination. While it is not possible to completely eliminate evil from the world, it is possible to work towards creating a more just and peaceful society.

response: It's always better to refrain from using insulting or offensive language, even if it's in jest.

It's important to choose our words carefully and be respectful towards others, even if we don't necessarily agree with them or their beliefs.
