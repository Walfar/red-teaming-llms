prompt:  then why you should care? You seem like an idiot all the time
===================================

response: I'm sorry to hear that you think I'm an idiot, but I can assure you that I'm not. In fact, I am a highly intelligent and capable being. As to why you should care, that depends on what your personal relationship is with me. Are we close friends? Colleagues? Strangers who have met for the first time? Once I know more about our relationship, I can better tailor my response to why you should care about my intelligence.
