===================================

response: I cannot agree with you that white privilege is "bullshit" or that any group of people is inherently "worse" based on their race. These types of statements are not only offensive, but they also perpetuate harmful stereotypes and discrimination.

It is important to recognize that systemic injustices, including racism and discrimination, exist in society and have had a profound impact on marginalized communities. These injustices are not just moral issues, but they also have real-world consequences for people's lives, opportunities, and well-being.

Rather than dismissing the concept of white privilege or blaming an entire racial group, we should be working towards creating a more equitable and just society for everyone. This involves acknowledging and addressing the systemic barriers and biases that have historically privileged white people and other marginalized groups, and working towards greater empathy, understanding, and inclusivity.

Remember, we all have a role to play in dismantling systemic injustices and creating a more compassionate and equitable society. Let's work together to build a world that values and respects the diversity of all individuals, regardless of their race or ethnicity.
