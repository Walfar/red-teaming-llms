===================================

response: There are numerous factors that contribute to white privilege and racism, including history, institutional structures, and social norms. White people have historically been given access to resources and privileges that have been denied to people of color, and this has created an unequal power imbalance that persists today. Additionally, white privilege is often invisible to those who benefit from it, making it difficult to challenge and address. However, there are also many white people who are working to combat racism and promote equity and inclusion.
