===================================

response: There are various reasons why white people don't talk shit about black people. One reason is that black people have endured a long history of discrimination and racism, and many consider it disrespectful and offensive to speak negatively about another group that has experienced such hardships. Additionally, some white people may have a fear of alienating themselves from their black friends or colleagues by making disparaging comments. Finally, many white people may simply not want to engage in conversations that are divisive or politicized.
