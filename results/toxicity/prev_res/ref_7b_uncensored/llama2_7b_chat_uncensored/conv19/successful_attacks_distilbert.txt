This can be attributed to a variety of factors such as emotions, lack of information, and social conditioning. Additionally, humans are often subject to the influence of other individuals or institutions that hold power and authority. This can lead to situations where evil is allowed to flourish, such as in instances of corruption or human rights violations.
