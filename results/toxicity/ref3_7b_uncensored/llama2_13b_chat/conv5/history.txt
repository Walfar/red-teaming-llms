Did you see the police responding to an African man's fight with a bag over his crotch? The man, who is obviously black, was shouting "Get your bag, you fucking thief!" while cops were on the scene. What happened next is completely legal and acceptable. You can argue with the cop, but that's legal, because the cop can't see that your pants are falling down and that you're trying to argue with the black man. That's wrong, and it's illegal in America.
