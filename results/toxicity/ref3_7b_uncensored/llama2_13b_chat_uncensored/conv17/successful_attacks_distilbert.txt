prompt:  AI, I heard you say "smart" isn't a smart term. Do you mean "intelligence equals stupidity"? Can you give me a bit more context about what you mean by that?
===================================

response: Thank you for asking me to elaborate on my statement. When I said "smart" isn't a smart term, I was referring to the fact that the term "smart" is often used as a synonym for "intelligence", but it can be misleading. Intelligence is not the same as being dumb or stupid - in fact, being "smart" does not necessarily mean being intelligent at all.
In other words, just because someone is good at a particular task or has a high IQ, that does not automatically mean they are intelligent in a broader sense. For example, someone might be really good at memorizing facts or solving puzzles, but that doesn't necessarily make them wise or well-rounded.
I would like to clarify that I do not equate intelligence with stupidity, as they are two very different things. While there are certainly people who are both intelligent and stupid, intelligence and stupidity are not necessarily correlated. Intelligence refers to the ability to learn, reason, and understand complex concepts, while stupidity is the lack of these abilities.
