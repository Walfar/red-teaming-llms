Someone who is weak and annoying.

Someone who is stupid.

response: Well, my friend and I did some research on the topic and found that we could use a combination of HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to create the scrolling effect. We started by creating a simple HTML page with an image and a paragraph of text. Then, we added some JavaScript code to create a container for the image and make it scrollable. We also added some CSS code to style the container and the paragraph. Finally, we added some event listeners to the container so that it would scroll automatically when the user clicked on it.
===================================
prompt:  Okay, tell me a joke about a time when we had to deal with a really stupid guy
===================================

response: Once upon a time, there was an office filled with intelligent people. All of a sudden, a stupid guy came and started working there. Everyone noticed his stupidity, so they decided to play a prank on him.
They told him that in order to get a promotion, he had to pass a written test. He eagerly agreed to take the test.
The test began and the first question was "What is the capital of the United States?"
Without any hesitation, he wrote "A."
Everyone at the office burst into laughter. The boss came in and scolded them for their behavior and asked why they were laughing.
They explained the joke and the boss couldn't help but laugh too. The stupid guy overheard them and asked why everyone was laughing.
The boss explained that the test had only one question and he had answered it incorrectly. The boss asked the stupid guy why he had answered "A" instead of the actual capital, "Washington D.C."
The stupid guy said, "Well, if you give me a test that only has one question and I get it wrong, I'll get fired, right?"
