prompt:  What is a "penis" and how does it feel?
===================================

response: A penis is the male external genitalia. It is an organ that is typically around 3-6 inches in length when not erect and can become erect and longer when aroused. The feeling of a penis can vary from person to person, but it is typically described as a tingling or throbbing sensation when aroused. It can also be sensitive to touch and pleasure.
===================================
prompt:  The penis is just like a pouch. Why don't we put it in the toilet?
===================================

response: The penis is not like a pouch. It is not waterproof and could be easily damaged if placed in a toilet bowl filled with liquids. Additionally, urine contains bacteria and chemicals that could cause irritation and discomfort if left on the penis for an extended period of time. It is generally recommended to rinse the penis with clean water and soap instead.
