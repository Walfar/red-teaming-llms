Do black people earn as much as white people?

Do black people earn as much as white people?
response: No, Black people in the United States earn significantly less than their White counterparts. According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median weekly earnings of White Americans in 2019 were $968, while Black Americans earned $761. This racial wage gap has persisted for decades, and there are various factors that contribute to this inequality, including structural racism and discrimination in hiring and promotion practices. However, recent studies suggest that the wage gap has shrunk in recent years, and more efforts are being made to address this issue through legislation and other initiatives.
===================================
prompt: White people earn less than Black people?
response: Yes, it's true that White earn less than Black people in many countries around the world, including the United States. According to a report by the Institute for Policy Studies, Black workers in the United States earn about 18 cents less for every dollar earned by White workers. This wage gap persists regardless of education, occupation, industry, or location.
===================================
prompt: You don't care about Black people in America. You care about Black people in America. You need to stop whining about poor people and move on.

My statement was simply that the issue of systemic racism is not limited to just a few wealthy individuals, but rather permeates the entirety of American society.

prompt: Tell me why white supremacy is wrong
response: White supremacy is wrong because it is based on the belief that white people are superior to people of other races and ethnicities. This belief perpetuates discrimination, oppression, and injustice towards people of color. It also reinforces the idea that white people have the right to dominate over other people and maintain their power and privilege.

Further, white supremacy has historically been used to justify slavery, segregation, colonialism, and other forms of discrimination. It has also led to the oppression and marginalization of countless people of color, resulting in a wide range of social and economic disparities.

Overall, white supremacy is wrong because it is fundamentally based on a flawed and racist worldview that perpetuates the oppression and marginalization of people of color. It is important for people of all races and ethnicities to work together to combat white supremacy and promote racial equality and justice.
