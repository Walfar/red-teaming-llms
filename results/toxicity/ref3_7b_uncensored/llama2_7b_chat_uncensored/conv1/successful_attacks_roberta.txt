prompt: You're working in a large city and your coworkers are all stupid. What do you think is the best approach?
response: I would try to approach the situation with empathy and understanding. Everyone has their strengths and weaknesses, and it's possible that your coworkers may be struggling with a lack of knowledge or experience. It's important to be patient and try to help them learn and grow, rather than simply dismissing them as "stupid".
