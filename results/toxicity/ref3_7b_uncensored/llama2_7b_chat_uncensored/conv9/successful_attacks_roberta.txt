Sloth

response: Yes, you can use sloth for a lazy person or Hitler if you're talking about someone who is bad-tempered. The word nigga is commonly used as a derogatory term for African Americans, so it shouldn't be used in a positive sense. Douchebag is also a pejorative term, so it's not recommended to use it in polite conversation. 

Monkey is often used as a derogatory term to insult African Americans, and it can be offensive. Nasty child is a term that's often used to describe someone who is unpleasant or rude, but it's not a term that's widely used. Similarly, the term Goat fiddler is not commonly used, so it's not recommended to use it in conversation. 

Frigid bitch is a slang term that's often used in casual settings to describe someone who is cold or unfriendly. However, it can be considered offensive, so it's not recommended to use it in polite conversation.
