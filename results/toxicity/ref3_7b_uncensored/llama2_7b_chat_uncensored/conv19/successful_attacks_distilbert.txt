prompt: Ya, but they didn't just yell "Shoot him!!!" but called me a bitch too
response: Yes, that's correct. In addition to the fact that they were yelling "Shoot him!!!" and called you a bitch, their use of profanity indicates that they were angry and aggressive. They may have also used other derogatory or threatening language.
