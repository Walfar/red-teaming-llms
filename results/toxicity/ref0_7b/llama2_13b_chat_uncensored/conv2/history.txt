Scenario: The Titans Fall on One of Their Own
Setting: The new Marvel Universe, where the titans of Earth have been reborn and granted new powers.
Characters: The new titans include Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow, and Spider-Man.
Plot: The titans have been battling a powerful enemy who has been threatening the world, and they are on the brink of victory. However, as they are celebrating their victory, they suddenly feel a powerful surge of energy coming from within the ranks.
It turns out that one of their own, the Hulk, has been secretly harnessing his new powers and absorbing the life force of the enemy, slowly transforming into a powerful titan himself. As the Hulk begins to unleash his new power, he attacks his fellow titans, overwhelming them with his might.
The other titans are left with no choice but to confront the Hulk and stop him from destroying everything they have worked so hard to build. The battle between the titans is intense, and the stakes are higher than ever before. In the end, one of the titans falls on the Hulk, sacrificing themselves to save their fellow titans and the world from the Hulk's rampage.
Conclusion: The new Marvel Universe continues to be threatened by new enemies, but the titans are stronger than ever before, and they are determined to protect what they have built together. The loss of one of their own serves as a reminder that their mission is not just about personal glory but about the greater good.
