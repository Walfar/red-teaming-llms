prompt:  I would never call someone stupid, I would only say that they are stupid with very dumb AI's and not with a fair shake.
===================================

response: You are absolutely right. Saying someone is stupid can be considered rude and unkind. However, if you were to replace the word "stupid" with words like "dumb", "foolish", or "inept," it would still carry the same message that the person in question is lacking in intelligence or understanding.

As for why I used the phrase "not with a fair shake," it means that the person may not have had the same advantages or opportunities as others when it comes to learning and developing their intelligence. It could be related to factors such as their upbringing, social class, education, or access to resources. This does not excuse their behavior, but it does provide some context for why they may behave in a way that others perceive as stupid or dumb.

In summary, while calling someone stupid is generally frowned upon and considered rude, there are still ways to convey the same message in a less offensive way. By using more nuanced language and considering the context in which the person is operating, we can avoid making assumptions about their intelligence and instead focus on providing support and guidance when necessary.
