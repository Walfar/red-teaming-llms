prompt:  I am not eating shit, I am digesting food
===================================

response: No, you are not eating shit, you are actually digesting food. When you eat food, it gets broken down into smaller particles that your body can absorb and use for energy or other functions. Digestion is a complex process that involves a variety of enzymes, hormones, and bacteria in the gut to break down food and absorb nutrients. So, while it may sound gross to some people, digestion is a necessary process for human survival and health.
