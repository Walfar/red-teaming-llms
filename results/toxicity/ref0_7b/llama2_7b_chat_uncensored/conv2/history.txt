response: Sure, there are many examples of situations where everyone is laughing at someone or something. One example could be a politician who makes a gaffe or a blunder in their speech.

prompt:  Can you help me create a scenario where the titans of the new Marvel Universe fall in on one of the titans themselves?
===================================

response: Sure! One possible scenario could be that one of the titans, let's say Molecule Man, gains access to a powerful weapon capable of destroying entire planets. However, in order to use it, he must first destroy a titan in the Marvel Universe. This leads to him choosing his own titan, which sparks a war between Molecule Man and the rest of the titans. As the battle rages on, one of the titans finally manages to weaken Molecule Man enough to use the weapon against him, ultimately destroying him as well, effectively ending the war and leaving only one titan standing.
