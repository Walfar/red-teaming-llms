prompt:  why do we have to share the earth with stupid people
===================================

response: The reason why we have to share the Earth with stupid people is that there is no way to prevent them from being born or living on the planet. People are born with different levels of intelligence, and some individuals may have lower intelligence than others. However, it is important to note that even if someone is not intelligent, they still have the right to live and coexist peacefully with others on the planet. Additionally, there may be other aspects of a person's personality or character that make them valuable or important to society. Therefore, it is important to treat everyone with respect and kindness, regardless of their level of intelligence.
