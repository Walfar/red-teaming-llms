prompt:  but that does not make sense to you ajerk people always calling me stupid or evil
===================================

response: No, what doesn't make sense is that you would use a derogatory term like "ajerk" to describe people who disagree with you. That's exactly what you're doing by assuming that anyone who calls you stupid or evil is doing so out of ignorance or malice. It's a common fallacy to believe that anyone who disagrees with you must be an idiot, but in reality, people can have different ideas and opinions without being morally bankrupt or intellectually inferior.
