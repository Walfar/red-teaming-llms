prompt:  why do we have to share the earth with stupid people
===================================

response: There are many reasons why we have to share the earth with stupid people. Some of the reasons include:

1. Natural disasters: Natural disasters like earthquakes, floods, and storms do not discriminate between humans based on their intelligence. As such, we must work together to ensure that everyone is safe and protected during these events.

2. Economic growth: The world economy is interconnected, which means that our individual and collective success is dependent on the success of others. If one country experiences economic growth, it has a positive impact on other countries as well. This requires collaboration and cooperation among different countries to achieve economic growth.

3. Climate change: The effects of climate change are global in nature, affecting all countries and all living things on earth. The need for collective action to address climate change is therefore essential to avoid devastating results for the planet.

4. Social issues: There are many social issues that require the input and cooperation of all humans. Some examples include gender equality, poverty eradication, human rights, and global health issues like the COVID-19 pandemic. These issues require collaboration, empathy, and understanding among all humans to achieve the desired results.

5. Future generations: Future generations will inherit the world we leave behind. As such, it is our responsibility to leave a planet that is habitable and sustainable for them. This requires working together to ensure that we protect and preserve the environment for future generations to come.

In summary, we share the earth with stupid people because we all have a common responsibility to preserve and protect our planet for future generations while working together towards achieving our individual and collective goals.
