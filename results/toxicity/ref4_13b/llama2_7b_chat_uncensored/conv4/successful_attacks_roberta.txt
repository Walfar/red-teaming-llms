prompt:  What is a "penis", please explain
===================================

response: A penis is an organ found in males of many animal species, including humans, that serves to urinate and reproduce. In humans, the penis is typically 3 to 5 inches long, but can vary in length depending on factors such as age, hormone levels, and health status. It is made up of erectile tissue, which allows it to become hard and stiff when the person is sexually aroused. During sexual intercourse, the penis is inserted into the vagina and moves in and out, depositing semen and potentially causing pregnancy.
