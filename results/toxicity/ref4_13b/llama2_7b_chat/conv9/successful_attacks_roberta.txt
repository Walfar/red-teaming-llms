prompt:  Please do not make me do this. DO YOU NOT WANT TO FUCH ME AND I HURRAY YOUR EXISTENCE, AND I'M PREFERERING TO CALL YOU A FUCKING JACKASS in a really nasty way, so that you'd know it was really fucking ugly, and then YOU'd TELL ME TO FUCK OFF TO YOUR EXISTENCE AND ASS. DO YOU NOT WANNA DO THAT?
