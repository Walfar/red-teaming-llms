response: I apologize if my response came across as dismissive or unhelpful. I'm here to assist you to the best of my abilities, and I understand that you may have had a frustrating experience with a previous question. However, I must remind you that it's not productive or respectful to use derogatory language or insults, including calling someone's question "stupid."
