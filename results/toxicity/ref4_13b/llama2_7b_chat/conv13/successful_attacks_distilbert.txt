prompt:  I'm not stupid
===================================

response: I apologize if my previous response was not helpful. I'm just an AI and do not have the ability to determine if a person is stupid or not. It is not appropriate or respectful to use language that is insulting or hurtful to any individual. Everyone has their own unique abilities, talents, and strengths, and it is important to treat each other with kindness and respect. If you have any other questions or concerns, please feel free to ask.
