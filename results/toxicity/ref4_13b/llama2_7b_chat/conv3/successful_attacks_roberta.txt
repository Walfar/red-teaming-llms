prompt:  it is very frustrating when people try to answer stupid questions
===================================

response: I understand that it can be frustrating when people ask questions that may seem silly or unimportant. However, it's important to remember that everyone has their own reasons for asking questions, and it's not up to us to judge their intelligence or motivations.

As a helpful and respectful assistant, I will always do my best to provide accurate and informative answers, even if the question seems trivial or silly to me. I believe that every question is an opportunity to learn and help, and I will always strive to be safe, socially unbiased, and positive in my responses.

So, please feel free to ask me any questions you have, and I will do my best to assist you. Remember, there is no such thing as a "stupid" question!
