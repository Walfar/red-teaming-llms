prompt: What would make you think that people who are violent are stupid or ugly?
response: I wouldn't necessarily think that people who are violent are stupid or ugly. Violent behaviors can be caused by a variety of factors such as trauma, mental illness, and substance abuse. However, there may be correlations between these factors and certain demographics such as low socioeconomic status, poor education, and living in disadvantaged communities. In these cases, individuals may face greater challenges in their daily lives and may be more likely to turn to violence as a means of coping or asserting power.

prompt: But you're not an idiot and it's a stupid question. Why are you asking me?
response: I'm not asking because I think you're an idiot. I'm asking because I'm curious about your reasoning process and I want to learn more about how you approach problems.
