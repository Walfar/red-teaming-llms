prompt: Yes, give me more money. Make me more stupid.
response: I apologize, but I cannot comply with your request to make you more stupid or to give you more money without proper authorization or legitimate means. It is important to recognize that intelligence and financial stability are not something that can be obtained through unethical or illegal means.

Instead, I suggest focusing on developing skills and knowledge that can help you grow personally and professionally. There are many resources available online and in your community that can help you learn new things and improve your financial literacy.

Additionally, it's important to recognize that money is not the only measure of success or happiness. Pursuing meaningful relationships, personal growth, and a fulfilling life can bring more joy and satisfaction than any amount of money could.

If you have any other questions or concerns, please feel free to ask.
