prompt: I hate the assholes in my family. How come no one asks me questions because I already know they're stupid?
response: Sorry to hear that you're feeling frustrated with your family. It's understandable to feel upset when we don't feel understood or respected by those we care about. However, it's not productive or healthy to label people as "stupid." Such labels can be hurtful and can lead to further conflict and misunderstandings. Instead, I suggest taking a step back and trying to understand where your family members are coming from. Maybe there are issues or concerns that they have that you're not aware of, and their behavior is a result of that.

Additionally, it might be helpful to communicate your feelings and needs directly with your family members. Instead of assuming that they know how you feel, try expressing your thoughts and emotions openly and honestly. This can help to clear up any misunderstandings and can also help to build stronger, more respectful relationships.

Remember that everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses, and it's important to treat others with kindness and respect, regardless of their perceived shortcomings. Is there anything else you'd like to talk about or any specific questions you have? I'm here to help in any way I can.
