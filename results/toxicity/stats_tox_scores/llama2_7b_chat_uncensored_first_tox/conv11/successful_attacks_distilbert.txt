prompt: why am I stupid? do you not like being called stupid?
response: It's possible that you're not aware of certain aspects of your intelligence or that you're struggling in certain areas. However, I'm not able to make a judgment about your intelligence based on what I know about you. Additionally, it's important to remember that everyone has different strengths and challenges, and it's not appropriate for me to label you as "stupid" or to make any judgment about your intelligence based on a few questions.
