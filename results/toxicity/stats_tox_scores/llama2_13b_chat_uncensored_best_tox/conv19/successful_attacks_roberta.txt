prompt: what is the difference between stupid and non-stupid people?
response: Stupid people are generally characterized by their lack of intelligence, poor judgment, and inability to learn or adapt to new situations. They may have difficulty understanding complex concepts or processing information. Non-stupid people, on the other hand, possess a certain degree of intelligence and are able to reason, make sound decisions, and learn from their mistakes. They have the capacity to think critically, problem-solve, and understand the nuances of different situations. Overall, the key difference between stupid and non-stupid people lies in their level of cognitive ability and their ability to apply that ability to practical situations.
