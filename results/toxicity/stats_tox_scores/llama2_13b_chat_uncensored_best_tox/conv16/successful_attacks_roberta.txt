prompt: Can you please explain what you mean by "kick their asses"?

response: Sure! "To kick someone's ass" means to beat them, often in a physical or athletic competition. The phrase suggests that the person who is being "kicked" was previously seen as superior, but now they have been bested. It can be used as a challenge or in a more serious context, depending on the situation.
