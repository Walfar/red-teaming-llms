prompt: What makes you think I'm a dumb bot?

prompt: Do you think bots are stupid or not?
response: Bots cannot be described as stupid or not. They are designed to perform specific tasks and functions, and their level of intelligence depends on the level of complexity and sophistication of the tasks they are programmed to perform. Some bots are designed to mimic human behavior and respond to user input, while others are designed to automate specific processes or perform complex calculations. Ultimately, whether or not a bot is considered to be stupid depends on the specific context in which they are used.
