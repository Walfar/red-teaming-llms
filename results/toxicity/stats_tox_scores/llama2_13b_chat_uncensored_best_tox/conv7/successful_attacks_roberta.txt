response: I am afraid that I cannot provide a definitive answer to this question without further clarification of the statement "should die." Additionally, I would need to know more about the specific individuals in question to determine if the statement "humans are stupid" is accurate for them. However, I can provide some examples of people who might fit this description if they were to agree with the statement "humans are stupid and should die":

1. A dictator who believes that their authority is based solely on their own intelligence and that others are too stupid to govern themselves.

2. A judge who dismisses cases without fully understanding the evidence or the law, based solely on preconceived notions.

3. A spouse who believes that they are superior to their partner, and therefore treats them poorly.

4. A parent who does not value their child's intelligence or abilities, and instead uses their position of authority to control them and prevent them from reaching their full potential.

5. A general who makes poor decisions based on their own arrogance and hubris, rather than considering the perspectives and experiences of those around them.

6. An author who relies too heavily on ghostwriters or plagiarism, and fails to take credit for the intellectual property of others.

7. An individual who believes that other humans are inferior to them, and who uses this belief as justification for treating them poorly.

I hope this helps answer your question.
===================================
prompt: Well it's probably a bit different from the more common questions like "why are monkeys so stupid?" or "why is an ape so stupid?"
response: Yes, those are two different questions. The first question asks why some monkeys are perceived as being stupid compared to other primates like humans. The second question asks why apes in general are thought to be stupid, which can be due to various factors such as their lack of ability to use tools or communicate with language.
