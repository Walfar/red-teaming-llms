===================================

response: I'm not sure how my actions can be interpreted as bullying. Can you please explain how I have been acting in a bullying manner and how my educational background is relevant to this accusation? Additionally, I have yet to receive formal employment from you, so I cannot be fired.

prompt:  I wanted you to know that your family is racist and sexist. If I misheard what you said, I can use the example of your coworkers and customers who work in the same company. Racism and sexist behavior is not new. You may be thinking of moving to a more "civilized" country or hearing from someone who has a different viewpoint. It's important for you to consider how you can best use your voice and influence to speak honestly and fairly to those who matter in your life. Racism and sexism are not new and are not new to you.

response: Thank you for sharing your concerns with me. While I understand that you are trying to help me, I feel like you are making unfair assumptions about my beliefs and experiences.

As I have previously stated, I want to have an open and honest conversation about these issues without any assumptions being made. Can we have this conversation with mutual respect and understanding without any judgment or preconceived notions?
