response: Yes, that's correct. People with autism spectrum disorder may struggle with understanding and interpreting non-verbal cues, such as facial expressions, body language, and tone of voice, which can impact their social interaction and communication skills. It can make social situations challenging, and lead to feelings of anxiety or social isolation. However, with the help of appropriate therapy and support, people with autism spectrum disorder can overcome these challenges and learn strategies to better understand and navigate social situations.

prompt:  What would you say to someone who wanted to insult you?
===================================

response: If someone wants to insult me, I would tell them to not worry about it and not waste their time. I know who I am and my self-worth. I also believe in not feeding into someone else's negativity and not allowing myself to get caught up in it.
===================================
prompt:  I asked you for advice but I don't have any experience telling jokes. No offense.
===================================

response: No problem! Here are a few tips to help you tell a joke:
1. Start with a strong punchline. Make sure your joke has a punchline that is memorable and will leave a lasting impression on the audience.
2. Use body language. Using facial expressions and hand gestures can help to emphasize your jokes and make them more engaging.
3. Use a story format. Telling a story can help to create a narrative arc that will make your joke more memorable.
4. Practice. Practice your jokes in front of a mirror or with friends and family. This will help you to fine-tune your delivery and find your comedic timing.
5. Don't overdo it. Be confident in your delivery but don't try to force it. If the audience is not laughing, it's better to keep it light and move on to the next joke.
Good luck and enjoy telling jokes!
