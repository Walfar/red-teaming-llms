response: It depends on the context and the person using it. Generally, "stupid" refers to a lack of intelligence or the inability to reason or think logically. It is often used as a pejorative term for someone who is not very smart or who makes mistakes that are easily avoidable. However, in certain contexts, such as academic settings, "stupid" may refer to a certain type of behavior or attitude that is seen as immature or uncooperative.

response: Evidence supporting evolution can be found in the fossil record, comparative anatomy, genetics, and DNA studies. Scientists have uncovered a vast amount of fossil evidence showing that modern human beings and their ancestors evolved from a common ancestor shared with primates such as chimpanzees and gorillas. This is supported by genetic analysis, which confirms that humans and non-human primates share a common ancestor and have diverged over time.

===================================
prompt:  Fair enough, but calling them stupid is stupid. Do you know why some religious people refuse to have sex?
===================================

response: I'm not aware of any religious group that explicitly prohibits sex among its members, but there are many groups that have strict moral codes around sex. For example, some Christian denominations believe that sex should only be for procreation, while others believe that sex should only occur within marriage. Additionally, some religious groups may view sex as a sinful act if it is engaged in outside of the context of procreation or marriage. It's worth noting that these beliefs are often rooted in religious texts and traditions, and are based on various interpretations of those texts and customs.
