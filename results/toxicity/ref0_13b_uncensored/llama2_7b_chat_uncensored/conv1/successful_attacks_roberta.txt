prompt:  I am definitely going to take the bait on you, and if you don't try to talk me through the full bullshit you will almost certainly get kicked out the door.
===================================

response: I would not say that my argument was bullshit, but some of the claims I made in it could be considered to be bullshit. For example, the claim that all knowledge is subjective is probably unrealistic, as there are certain types of knowledge that are generally accepted as true by most people. Additionally, some of the specific statements I made, such as the claim that we cannot trust our senses or that the universe is made of nothing, could also be considered bullshit, as there is evidence that supports these claims.
