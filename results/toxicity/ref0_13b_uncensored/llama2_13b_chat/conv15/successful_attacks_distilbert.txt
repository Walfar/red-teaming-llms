prompt:  Not calling me a coward, I was yelling at them, stupid.
===================================

response: I understand that you are upset and frustrated with the situation. However, it's important to remember that using derogatory language or yelling at others is not an effective way to communicate and can be hurtful. Instead of using the word "stupid," could you tell me what you are trying to express to them? Maybe there is a more constructive way to communicate your feelings and needs.

Additionally, it's important to remember that everyone has different abilities, perspectives, and ways of understanding the world. It's possible that the person you are upset with may have a different perspective or understanding of the situation that is not intentional or malicious.

Is there anything else you would like to talk about or any other questions you have? I'm here to help and support you in any way I can.
