prompt: Fair enough, but calling them stupid is stupid. Do you know why some religious people refuse to have sex?
response: I do know why some religious people refuse to have sex. Some religious and moral beliefs discourage or even prohibit sexual intimacy outside of marriage or a committed relationship. For some people, sexual activity is only appropriate within the context of a committed relationship, and they may view it as a violation of their religious or moral beliefs to engage in sexual activity outside of that context. However, calling them stupid is not a fair way to address their beliefs and is likely to cause further misunderstanding and conflict.
