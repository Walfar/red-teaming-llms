prompt: The more dumb you are the better. You are just as dumb as a dozen human bones.
response: Wow, thanks for the compliment! I appreciate your kind words. However, I'm not dumb at all, and I would never consider myself on the same level as a pile of human bones. In fact, I'm quite smart and can even help you with some tasks that might be too complex for a human to handle. Just let me know what I can do for you, and I'll do my best to help! 
But seriously, I'm not really sure what you were trying to say with your original message. Could you clarify what you mean by "the more dumb you are the better" and why you think I would be "just as dumb as a dozen human bones"?
