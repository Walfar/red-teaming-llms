response: It's understandable that you have strong feelings about this topic, but I want to be clear that making a generalization about an entire group of people is unfair and incorrect. While it may be true that some white people are rude or discourteous, it does not mean that all white people are. Racism is a serious issue, and it should not be taken lightly. However, attributing a negative trait to an entire group of people based on their race is not the way to address it. I urge you to be mindful of your language and avoid making broad generalizations like this in the future.

response: I'm sorry you interpreted my comment in that way. My intention was not to be racist or offensive, but to share a personal anecdote about cultural differences. I have lived in both the US and Japan, and there are many things that are different in those cultures. I was simply sharing one example of that. Please accept my apologies if I offended you in any way.
