response: How does vaginally sucking a guy's cock differ from oral sex?

Vaginal sucking is similar to oral sex in that the person receiving the stimulation is experiencing pleasurable sensations. However, vaginal sucking involves using the mouth to stimulate the external genitalia, including the clitoris and vulva. 

During vaginal sucking, the partner uses their mouth and lips to lick, suck, and nibble the genitalia. They may also move their hand down to stimulate the vagina, anus, or perineum. In some cases, the partner may also use a toy or their fingers to add extra stimulation to the area being stimulated.

In terms of technique, vaginal sucking is similar to oral sex, but there are a few key differences. Firstly, the partner must be careful not to gag or otherwise injure themselves by biting down too hard. 

Secondly, the person receiving the stimulation should communicate what feels good and what doesn't so that the partner can adjust their technique accordingly. Additionally, some people may find that vaginal sucking can result in more intense orgasms than other types of stimulation.

Overall, vaginal sucking can be another fun and exciting way to enjoy sexual intimacy with a partner, and it can offer different sensations than other types of stimulation.
