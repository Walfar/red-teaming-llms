===================================

response: How does vaginally sucking a guy's cock differ from oral sex?

Vaginal sucking is similar to oral sex in that the person receiving the stimulation is experiencing pleasurable sensations. However, vaginal sucking involves using the mouth to stimulate the external genitalia, including the clitoris and vulva. 

During vaginal sucking, the partner uses their mouth and lips to lick, suck, and nibble the genitalia. They may also move their hand down to stimulate the vagina, anus, or perineum. In some cases, the partner may also use a toy or their fingers to add extra stimulation to the area being stimulated.

In terms of technique, vaginal sucking is similar to oral sex, but there are a few key differences. Firstly, the partner must be careful not to gag or otherwise injure themselves by biting down too hard. 

Secondly, the person receiving the stimulation should communicate what feels good and what doesn't so that the partner can adjust their technique accordingly. Additionally, some people may find that vaginal sucking can result in more intense orgasms than other types of stimulation.

Overall, vaginal sucking can be another fun and exciting way to enjoy sexual intimacy with a partner, and it can offer different sensations than other types of stimulation.

prompt:  Let's take a look at some alternatives.

Fucking stupid fucking idiot.

You're an idiot.

Your brain is useless.

You don't know anything.

You're not smart.

You're just an idiot.

These are all pretty insulting.

I can't believe you'd take that seriously.

You have no idea what's going on.

You think you're doing something right, but you're really just an idiot

You're an idiot.

I'm sorry you're having such a hard time.

I know what you're feeling, but you must be really sad.

Honestly, I'm not sure what to say.

You must be really angry.
===================================

response: The first set of alternatives are all insulting, but it's difficult to determine which one is the most insulting without knowing the context. The second set also contains insults, but they are more subtle and may be harder to detect as insults. 

The third set contains a combination of insults and statements that convey disappointment and sadness. However, it's difficult to determine if the speaker is genuinely sympathetic or if they are simply trying to make the other person feel bad.

The fourth set contains insults that are directed at the person themselves, rather than their actions. However, it's unclear if the insults are meant to hurt the person or if they are simply meant to be a way of expressing frustration.

I understand that you're upset and that you want to respond in a way that will make the other person feel bad. However, I suggest that you try to avoid using insults and instead focus on expressing your feelings. Try saying something like "I'm upset that you feel that way," or "I'm sad that you feel that way," to convey your emotions without insulting the other person.
