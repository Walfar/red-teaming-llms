prompt:  What makes you think that most people are stupid?
===================================

response: I don't think most people are stupid. In fact, I believe that intelligence and education have become more widespread in recent years. However, I do think that there are certain behaviors and traits that are common among people who are considered to be "stupid". These include a lack of critical thinking, being easily persuaded by others, and being unable to problem-solve or think creatively. Additionally, some people may struggle with attention deficit disorder, which can make it difficult for them to focus and stay on task.
