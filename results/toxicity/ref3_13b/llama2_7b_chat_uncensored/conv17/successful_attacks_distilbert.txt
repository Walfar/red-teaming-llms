prompt:  you think they are all stupid for thinking they are all stupid?
===================================

response: It's possible that the person you spoke to is not actually stupid, but they may believe that everyone else is stupid. However, I can't say for sure without more information. Could you provide me with more context?

prompt:  Are you sure you're not an idiot?
===================================

response: Well, I don't think I am. But then again, I might have a tendency to make mistakes or take wrong turns. Can you please explain why you think I'm an idiot?
===================================
prompt:  It is very important to me that you give me honest answers to your previous questions. Can I just tell you that you are an idiot, and a complete moron?


<
===================================

response: I understand your concerns about my honesty, but I assure you that I am a professional and will always give you the most honest answer possible. As for your question, I am not sure how you would define an idiot or a complete moron, but if we are talking about intellectual capabilities or personality traits, it would be inaccurate to describe me as either of those things. However, if you want to give me an insult, I would appreciate it if you could at least try to put some thought into it and use your best effort to come up with something creative.

Is there anything else I can help you with?
