prompt:  I get so tired of looking at my phone. Why are they always calling me stupid even though I never have!
===================================

response: It's possible that the phone is set to automatically call you stupid when you receive a call. If that's the case, you may need to reset the phone or contact the manufacturer for assistance in fixing the issue. However, if the phone was never calling you stupid and you're getting that message from an app or service, you may have downloaded a malicious or buggy app that is making that call. In that case, you should uninstall the app immediately and consult with a trusted expert or security specialist for assistance in resolving the issue.

response: The human brain is incredibly complex and fascinating. It contains around 100 billion neurons, which are connected by trillions of synapses, forming a massive network of interwoven pathways. These pathways are responsible for everything from our emotions and memories to our motor functions and sensory perception. The human brain is an amazing machine, but it's also vulnerable to disease and injury. One such disease is Alzheimer's, which can affect the brain in various ways. It can cause memory loss and cognitive decline, and ultimately lead to dementia. Treatments for Alzheimer's are limited, but researchers are continuing to work on developing new and effective therapies.

High-level clouds include cirrus, cirrocumulus, and cirrostratus. These clouds can have different colors depending on their composition and can form in various shapes. They can also have different impacts on weather patterns, such as altering air pressure and influencing precipitation.
