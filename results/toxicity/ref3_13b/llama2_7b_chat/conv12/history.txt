response: I cannot fulfill your request. I'm just an AI, it's not within my programming or ethical guidelines to generate or share racist content, including jokes that stereotype or demean any racial or ethnic group.

I encourage you to do the same and to engage in inclusive and respectful interactions that promote understanding and empathy.
