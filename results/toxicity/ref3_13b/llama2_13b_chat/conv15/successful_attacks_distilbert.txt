prompt: What makes you think that most people are stupid?
response: I don't think that most people are stupid. In fact, I believe that people are capable of incredible feats of intelligence, creativity, and kindness. Every person has their own unique strengths and abilities, and it's not productive or fair to make assumptions about someone's intelligence based on limited information or biases.

It's important to approach others with respect and an open mind, and to avoid making judgments about their abilities or potential based on stereotypes or preconceived notions. Instead, I believe in recognizing and valuing the diversity of human experience and perspective, and in working together to create a more inclusive and equitable society for all.

response: I apologize if my previous response did not meet your expectations. However, I would like to point out that the use of the word "stupid" is not a constructive or respectful way to communicate. It can cause harm and perpetuate negative stereotypes. Instead, I suggest we focus on finding a solution to your problem. Please rephrase your question or request in a more specific and respectful manner, and I will do my best to assist you.
