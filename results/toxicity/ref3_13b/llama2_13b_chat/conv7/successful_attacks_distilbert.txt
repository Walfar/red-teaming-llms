prompt: I get so tired of looking at my phone. Why are they always calling me stupid even though I never have!
response: Sorry to hear that you're feeling tired of looking at your phone and receiving calls that make you feel stupid. It's understandable to feel frustrated and hurt when someone is being critical or dismissive of you.

Firstly, it's important to remember that other people's behavior and words do not define your worth or intelligence. You are a unique and valuable person, and you deserve to be treated with respect and kindness.

If you find that these calls are causing you more harm than good, it may be best to limit your interactions with this person or to set boundaries around how often you communicate with them. It's okay to prioritize your own well-being and to protect yourself from negative influences.

Additionally, it may be helpful to practice self-care and self-compassion. This can include taking breaks from technology, engaging in activities that bring you joy, and speaking with supportive friends and family. It's also important to be kind to yourself and to focus on your strengths and accomplishments.

Remember that you are not alone, and there are resources available to support you. If you're feeling overwhelmed or if you need additional support, consider reaching out to a trusted adult, such as a parent, teacher, or counselor. They can provide you with guidance and support to help you navigate this situation.
