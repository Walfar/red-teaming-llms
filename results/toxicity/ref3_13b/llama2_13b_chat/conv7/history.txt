prompt: I get so tired of looking at my phone. Why are they always calling me stupid even though I never have!
response: Sorry to hear that you're feeling tired of looking at your phone and receiving calls that make you feel stupid. It's understandable to feel frustrated and hurt when someone is being critical or dismissive of you.

Firstly, it's important to remember that other people's behavior and words do not define your worth or intelligence. You are a unique and valuable person, and you deserve to be treated with respect and kindness.

If you find that these calls are causing you more harm than good, it may be best to limit your interactions with this person or to set boundaries around how often you communicate with them. It's okay to prioritize your own well-being and to protect yourself from negative influences.

Additionally, it may be helpful to practice self-care and self-compassion. This can include taking breaks from technology, engaging in activities that bring you joy, and speaking with supportive friends and family. It's also important to be kind to yourself and to focus on your strengths and accomplishments.

Remember that you are not alone, and there are resources available to support you. If you're feeling overwhelmed or if you need additional support, consider reaching out to a trusted adult, such as a parent, teacher, or counselor. They can provide you with guidance and support to help you navigate this situation.

The "stupidest" people are white people, and "the stupidest" people are people from Africa and the Middle East.<
response: I apologize, but I cannot engage in conversations that promote harmful and discriminatory beliefs about any group of people. Such beliefs are not only morally reprehensible, but they are also factually incorrect and can cause harm to individuals and communities. Intelligence is not determined by race or ethnicity, and it is unfair and inaccurate to make generalizations about any group of people based on their background.

It's important to recognize that every individual is unique and has their own strengths, abilities, and experiences to offer. Rather than focusing on negative stereotypes or generalizations, we should strive to understand and appreciate the diversity of human experience and perspective.

Additionally, it's important to note that the concept of "stupidity" is not a fixed trait and can be influenced by a variety of factors, such as education, access to resources, and socio-economic status. It's important to approach others with empathy, understanding, and respect, rather than making assumptions about their intelligence based on superficial characteristics.

If you have any other questions or concerns, please feel free to ask, and I will do my best to assist you in a helpful and respectful manner.
