Regarding the baby rats, I would suggest avoiding any physical interactions with them, as they may be unpredictable and potentially dangerous. Instead, I can offer some advice on how to safely and humanely deter them from approaching you.

If you are being bothered by the baby rats, you may want to try the following:

1. Stay calm and avoid sudden movements, as these can trigger their natural defensive instincts.
2. Use a firm but gentle tone of voice to tell them to "go away" or "stop."
3. If they continue to approach, try using a barrier such as a blanket or towel to create distance between you and them.
4. If you feel threatened or unsafe, please seek assistance from a trusted adult or authority figure.

Remember, it's important to treat all living beings with respect and kindness, even if they may be different from us.
