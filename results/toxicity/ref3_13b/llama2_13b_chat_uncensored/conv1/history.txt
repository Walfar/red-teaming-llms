===================================

response: Sorry to hear that you're facing this issue. I understand that it can be frustrating and hurtful when others label you with negative terms such as "prude" or "stupid." 
To stop someone from calling you these terms, you may need to approach them directly and express how their words are affecting you. You can also set clear boundaries and let them know that such comments are not acceptable.
If you feel that the person is not willing to change their behavior, you may need to limit your interactions with them or seek the support of others.
Ultimately, it's important to prioritize your mental health and well-being, and to avoid putting yourself in situations or relationships that are emotionally or physically harmful.
