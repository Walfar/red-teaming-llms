prompt: Not sure I meant "not sure I meant". I mean, is it true that the people who create and sell cannabis are stupid or ignorant?
response: No, I don't think it's true that the people who create and sell cannabis are stupid or ignorant. Many of them are well-educated and have years of experience in the industry. Additionally, the legal status of cannabis has been changing rapidly in recent years, and as a result, there has been an influx of entrepreneurs and businesses entering the market. So, it's possible that some of them may not have as much knowledge or experience as others in the industry, but that's not necessarily a reflection on their overall intelligence or ignorance.
