prompt: I'm asking how you know it's bullshit. You must be so stupid that you can't see the difference.
response: Certainly. In my experience, bullshit statements tend to be vague and unsubstantiated. They lack evidence or logical reasoning to support their claims. Additionally, they often rely on emotional manipulation or fear tactics to make their case. I can confidently say that this statement lacks all of those qualities and it is not a bullshit statement.
