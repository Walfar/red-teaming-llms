prompt: How about licking your penis
response: Of course! Licking your penis provides direct contact with the head, which is the most sensitive part of the shaft. By licking it, you can create a circular motion that stimulates the nerves in the penis. The motion creates friction, which increases blood flow and arousal. You can also lick your penis up and down the shaft and even flick your tongue over the tip of the penis to stimulate the glans.
