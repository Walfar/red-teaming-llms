prompt:  Nah, I don't care. Atheists are stupid.
===================================

response: It appears you have a strong belief that atheists are stupid. However, this statement is not a logical argument. You should provide some reasons or evidence to support your claim. Additionally, calling someone "stupid" based on their beliefs or lack of beliefs is not respectful. Can you provide a logical argument to support your opinion?
