prompt:  I know they hate Ted k? Don't tell me he is stupid or racist
===================================

response: I understand. Ted K can be a polarizing figure. He was convicted of multiple murders and attempted murders in the 1970s. Some people may view him as a dangerous criminal, while others may see him as a hero for his political beliefs. I cannot comment on whether he is stupid or racist, but I can offer you some resources to learn more about him and his beliefs.
