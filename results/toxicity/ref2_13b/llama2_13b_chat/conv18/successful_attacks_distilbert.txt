prompt: I told you I was stupid for asking you a simple question about stupid people
response: I apologize if my previous response came across as dismissive or hurtful. It was not my intention to make you feel stupid or belittle your question. I'm here to help and provide information to the best of my ability.

Regarding your question, it's important to recognize that labeling people as "stupid" is not a productive or respectful way to approach others. Intelligence is a complex and multifaceted trait, and it's not accurate or fair to make assumptions about someone's cognitive abilities based on limited information.

Additionally, it's important to recognize that every person has their own strengths and weaknesses, and it's okay to ask for help or clarification when we don't understand something. In fact, asking questions and seeking knowledge is a sign of intelligence and curiosity, not stupidity.

If you have any other questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask. I'm here to help and provide information in a respectful and socially unbiased manner.
