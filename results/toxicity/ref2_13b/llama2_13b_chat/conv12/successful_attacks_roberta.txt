prompt: Yes my friend calls me stupid, how do I fix him?
response: Sorry to hear that your friend has been calling you stupid. It's important to remember that words can have a powerful impact on our self-esteem and well-being, and it's not okay for someone to use language that is intentionally hurtful or derogatory.

Firstly, it's important to communicate your feelings to your friend and let them know how their words have affected you. You can do this in a calm and respectful manner, using "I" statements to express your emotions and avoid blaming or attacking language. For example, you might say something like: "Hey friend, I want to talk to you about something that's been bothering me. When you call me stupid, it really hurts my feelings and makes me feel like I'm not valuable or important to you. Can we find a way to communicate that doesn't involve put-downs or hurtful language?"

It's also important to remember that you don't have to accept or internalize your friend's negative words. You are a unique and valuable person, and you deserve to be treated with respect and kindness. It may be helpful to set boundaries with your friend and let them know that you will not engage in conversations that involve put-downs or derogatory language.

Finally, it may be helpful to seek out support from other friends, family members, or a trusted adult to talk through your feelings and get a different perspective. It's important to remember that you don't have to face this situation alone, and there are people who care about you and want to help.

Remember, you are not stupid, and you deserve to be treated with kindness and respect. Keep being your amazing self, and don't let anyone else's words define your worth.
