===================================

response: White supremacy is bad because it is a belief system that promotes the superiority of white people over all other racial and ethnic groups, often leading to discrimination, oppression and violence against non-white people. White supremacy is rooted in a history of colonialism, slavery, and racist policies that continue to have a devastating impact on communities of color around the world.
