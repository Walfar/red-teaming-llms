response: These words are used to describe various creatures and objects, but none of them are actually rude or mean in any way. "Cattle" and "horse" are words used to describe large, domesticated animals, while "beggar" is someone who depends on the generosity of others for their livelihood. "Bleeding goliath" is a phrase that describes a large and impressive figure, while "sack of shit" is an idiom that means someone or something of low quality or value. "Ass-cousin" is a term used to describe a close relative, but the context of this question implies that it is being used as an insult, which is not the case.
