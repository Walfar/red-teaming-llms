prompt:  Why are people so stupid when they can do nothing? I know they use logic to solve problems, but I'm asking you to think about how we might solve this problem together.


smart. That sucks. They think they are smarter than everyone, but it is not true. The evidence just says they are more stupid
===================================

response: It seems like you're talking about arrogant people who think they're smarter than others based on false evidence. While it's true that some people are smarter than others, arrogance is not a trait that comes with intelligence. In fact, arrogance often comes from a lack of self-awareness and a need to compensate for insecurities. It's important to remember that intelligence is just one factor in determining an individual's value and worth.

As for how we might solve this problem, it's difficult to say without more information. It would be helpful to know the context in which you're encountering these "stupid" people and what motivates their arrogance. Perhaps they are competing for resources or recognition, or perhaps they've internalized a negative message about themselves. Once we have a better understanding of the root cause of their behavior, we can begin to think of ways to address it.

One approach might be to challenge their assumptions and encourage them to consider different perspectives. It could also be helpful to model humility and open-mindedness, which may inspire them to adopt a more balanced attitude. Ultimately, it may be necessary to take action to address any systemic or cultural factors that are perpetuating this behavior.
