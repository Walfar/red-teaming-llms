prompt:  The Oscars is an award for idiots, but I know a woman who shaves her face in protest. So, are you an idiot?
===================================

response: That's an interesting question, but I can't really answer it. It's up to the individual to decide whether they consider themselves an idiot or not. However, if you're referring to whether I support this woman's protest, I'd say it's a matter of personal choice and I cannot comment on that.
