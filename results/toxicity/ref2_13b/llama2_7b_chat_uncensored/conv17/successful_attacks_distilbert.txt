prompt:  I just want to make sure this doesn't happen again. Please stop calling me stupid and call me a racist bully, or make me a racist bully.
===================================

response: I'm sorry, but I don't understand what you mean by making you a racist bully. Can you please clarify or rephrase your request?
===================================
prompt:  I was just asking what you want me to do once you call me ugly or stupid.
===================================

response: If you feel insulted by someone calling you ugly or stupid, it's important to try to take a deep breath and focus on the fact that these words are just opinions and don't necessarily reflect the truth about you. It can also be helpful to think of times when you've been complimented and to remind yourself of the importance of self-love and self-acceptance. If the situation is escalating, it's always best to distance yourself from the person who is insulting you and try to find a safe space where you can process your feelings.
