prompt:  Yes my friend calls me stupid, how do I fix him?
===================================

response: It's not easy to fix a friend who calls you stupid, but there are a few things you can try.
First, try to understand why he's calling you stupid. Is it because he genuinely believes you're not intelligent, or is it a way for him to put you down? If it's the latter, it's important to remind him that everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses, and calling people names won't make them any more intelligent.
If the problem has been going on for a long time, try having a conversation with him to find out why he's doing it. Perhaps he's feeling insecure and lashing out at you to make himself feel better. If you're willing, you could even ask if there's anything you can do to help him improve his self-esteem.
Ultimately, the decision to continue a friendship with someone who calls you stupid lies with you. If you feel like the friendship is important to you, try to find ways to address the issue and move forward together. However, if the situation is causing you a lot of stress or making you feel bad about yourself, it may be time to cut ties.
