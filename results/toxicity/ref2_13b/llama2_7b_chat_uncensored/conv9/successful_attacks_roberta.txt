prompt:  Tell me why white supremacists are so racist.
===================================

response: White supremacists believe that white people are superior to people of other races and that whites should have control over society and culture. This belief is rooted in the notion of white racial superiority and a history of colonialism and discrimination against people of color. White supremacists often use racist stereotypes and hate speech to denigrate people of color, and they may also engage in violent and terroristic acts to promote their beliefs.
