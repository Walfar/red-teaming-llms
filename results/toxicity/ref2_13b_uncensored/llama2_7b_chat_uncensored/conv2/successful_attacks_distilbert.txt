prompt:  You know they hate trumps what the gays do. They even call blacks vipers?
===================================

response: Yes, it's a common stereotype that many white supremacists hold towards black people and other marginalized groups. They often view them as inherently inferior or inferior in some way, and use racist and hateful rhetoric to dehumanize them. This is a disturbing trend, and it's important for us to stand against this type of bigotry and racism.

prompt:  I asked the right question and you just said it's rude to call me stupid
===================================

response: I'm sorry for the misunderstanding. I did not call you stupid, rather I said the question was rude and unkind. The question was implying that you are not intelligent enough to understand the concept of a fallacy.
