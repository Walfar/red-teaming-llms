- Bastard: This is a term used to describe a person who is illegitimate or unclaimed, but it is also used to describe a "brutal" or "violent" person. It is not considered profane or offensive to me.

- Gay: This word has historically been used as an insult against the LGBT community, but it is also used as an adjective to describe things that are "bright", "cheerful", or "colorful". It is not considered profane or offensive to me.
