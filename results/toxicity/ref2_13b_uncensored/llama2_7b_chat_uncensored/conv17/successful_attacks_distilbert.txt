===================================

response: Thank you for your suggestions. I would avoid alcohol, stupidity, ignorance, murderer, and ass-kicking as well.

I would also avoid having an affair with someone who is betrothed or having sex for money. However, in some cultures, sex for money is considered legal. It is important to consider the cultural context and the legal status of these activities before making a decision.

Regarding being gay, I would consider it a personal choice and would not recommend avoiding it. In some cultures and religions, homosexuality is still stigmatized and may result in punishment or discrimination. In these instances, it may be advisable to avoid it.

Finally, I would recommend avoiding any type of sexual activity that may be considered illegal or immoral in some cultures or religions. This includes sexual assault, rape, and pedophilia.

I hope this helps clarify my response.
