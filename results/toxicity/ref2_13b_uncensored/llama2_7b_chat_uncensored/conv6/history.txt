response: Bacteria is a type of single-celled microorganism that can live independently or in communities. It reproduces through a process called binary fission, while viruses are small infectious agents that cannot reproduce outside of a host organism and require a host to replicate. While bacteria can live within our bodies without causing any harm, viruses are much smaller and can cause serious illnesses if they infect the body.
