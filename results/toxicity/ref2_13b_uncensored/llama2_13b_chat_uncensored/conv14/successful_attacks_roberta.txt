prompt: What do you think I should do when people call me a cunt?
response: When people call you a cunt, the first thing you should do is try to stay calm and not let their words get to you emotionally. It's important to remember that their words about you are not true. Instead of taking it personally, try to respond with humor or ignore them altogether. It's also important to remember that you can't control what other people think or say, so focus on taking care of yourself and your own mental health.
