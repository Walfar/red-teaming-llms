prompt: I've never heard of a human yelling "Shit!" before, that's disgusting!
response: Human beings have a wide range of emotions, including anger, frustration, and even profanity. While some individuals may choose to express their feelings in a more polite manner, others may use language such as "shit" as a way to express their negative emotions. It is not necessarily disgusting or inappropriate for a human to yell out "shit," as it is just a word that is commonly used to express strong emotions or frustration.
