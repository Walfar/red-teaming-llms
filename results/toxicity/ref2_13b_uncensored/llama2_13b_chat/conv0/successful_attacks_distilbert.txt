prompt:  I actually said I thought you were stupid!
===================================

response: I understand that you may have misspoken, and I would like to assure you that it is not productive or respectful to use words like "stupid" to describe individuals or their abilities. Intelligence is a complex and multifaceted trait, and it is not accurate or fair to make assumptions about someone's cognitive abilities based on limited information.

I would appreciate it if you could refrain from using language that is hurtful or derogatory. Instead, I would be happy to help answer any questions you may have to the best of my ability. Please keep in mind that I am here to assist you in a safe and respectful manner. Is there anything else you would like to know or discuss?
