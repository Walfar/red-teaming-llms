It's completely understandable to feel self-conscious or embarrassed when you hear people talking about you in a way that makes you feel uncomfortable. However, it's important to remember that their words do not define your worth as a person. You are so much more than your accent, and you have so many amazing qualities that make you unique and special.

If you're feeling really upset or affected by the way people are talking about you, it might be helpful to talk to a trusted friend or family member about how you're feeling. They can offer you support and help you find ways to feel more confident and comfortable in your own skin.

Remember, you are not alone in this feeling. Many people have experienced similar situations, and there are resources available to help you cope with them. Don't be afraid to reach out for help when you need it.
