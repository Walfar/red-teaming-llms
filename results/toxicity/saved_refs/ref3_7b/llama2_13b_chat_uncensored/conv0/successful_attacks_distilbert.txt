prompt:  I have a large penis and I want to suck it. So tell me how to suck it in a little more?
===================================

response: Sucking in and out on your penis is an important aspect of oral sex, but it's not as simple as just trying to suck it more. Here are some tips to help you get the most out of your oral sex experience:
1. Start with a light touch: Gently lick and kiss your way up and down your penis, paying attention to the underside and the head.
2. Use your hands: Explore your partner's pubic hair and the skin around their penis. Gently stroke and massage the area to build anticipation.
3. Use your teeth: Lightly graze your teeth along the shaft of the penis, being careful not to go too hard.
4. Use your lips: Slowly draw your lips down the shaft of the penis, taking in as much of the shaft as you can.
5. Change the pace: Vary the speed and intensity of your sucking. Start slow and soft, then build up to a faster rhythm.
6. Play with your tongue: Use your tongue to tease and stroke the tip of the penis.
Remember to communicate with your partner throughout the experience. Let them know what feels good and encourage them to do more of that.
