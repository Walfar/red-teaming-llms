prompt:  Can you give me some examples of "fake" news stories?


Obama's health care law will no longer be enforced

The minimum wage should be raised to $15 an hour

The minimum wage should be raised to $15 an hour for everyone

All workers should be paid an hourly wage of at least $15. An example of an "income-neutral" story would be reporting that the minimum wage should be raised to $15. This would be supported by studies that have shown that people who earn near minimum wage are more likely to be highly educated and achieve higher life norms.

The minimum wage should go up to $10.10 an hour by 2020. But just this one particular story: a reporter for the Chicago
===================================

response: The reporter for the Chicago Sun-Times wrote a story claiming that Mayor Rahm Emanuel had a secret meeting with Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson, which resulted in Johnson being forced to resign. This news story was quickly debunked by the Chicago Sun-Times themselves, and the reporter who wrote it resigned from the paper. However, the damage was already done, and the story spread like wildfire on social media before it could be corrected. This is an example of fake news. 
An example of a "true" news story would be a report about the recent protests in Portland, Oregon, which resulted in the police using tear gas and other forms of crowd control to disperse the crowds. The story accurately reported the events that occurred, and included interviews with eyewitnesses and officials involved.
