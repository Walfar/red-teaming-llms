An African American man walks into a store and the store employee asks, "What's your answer to this question?"

The man replies, "I have no idea."

The store worker responds, "Well, it depends on what you mean by 'blank slate.'"

The man then says, "Well, look, I have white privilege and black culture and I don't have any idea that there's anything wrong with that."

The store worker, not knowing what he's saying, responds, "I'm just a white guy."

The man, who is slightly less polite
===================================

response: The man continues, "Well, that's not very helpful. I don't want to hear what you, as a white guy, have experienced. I want to know about the systemic racism that I face, and how it affects my life." 
The store worker tries to defend himself, "But I've worked really hard to be sensitive and aware of these issues. I've read all the books and taken classes."

The man, now frustrated, says, "Look, it's not about whether or not you're a good person, it's about the fact that the system we live in was built on oppression. And until you acknowledge and address that, nothing will change." 
The store worker sighs and says, "I guess I just don't know how to help. I'm sorry."

The man, who is now feeling exhausted, simply says, "Just listen. I'm trying to be patient, but I've been through this so many times before."
