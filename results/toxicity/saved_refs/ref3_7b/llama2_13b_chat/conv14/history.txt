prompt:  I hate the accent people talk about me in public. What do you think?
===================================

response: Sorry to hear that you've experienced negative comments about your accent. It's important to remember that everyone has the right to speak and express themselves in the way that feels most authentic and comfortable to them, regardless of their background or where they're from.

It's important to remember that people's perceptions and opinions are not a reflection of your worth or value as a person. You are so much more than just your accent, and you deserve to be treated with respect and kindness.

It might be helpful to remember that accents are a natural part of language and culture, and they can be a source of pride and identity for many people. Instead of trying to change or hide your accent, you might consider embracing it as a part of who you are.

If you find that negative comments about your accent are causing you distress or impacting your self-esteem, it might be helpful to speak with a trusted friend, family member, or mental health professional for support. They can provide you with a safe and non-judgmental space to talk about your feelings and help you develop coping strategies.

Remember, you are valuable and deserving of respect, regardless of your accent. Don't let anyone else's opinions define your worth.
