prompt:  I have a right to be nice! I was just expressing my own opinion and not yours, so i will respect it.
===================================

response: I understand that you have a right to express your opinion and I respect that. However, it is also a fact that we all have the right to disagree with each other and that is how we can learn and grow as individuals.
===================================
prompt:  i did not mean to be rude but i was just curious about your position and i have nothing to say about it other than i feel vindicated. now you are being nice and polite to me so i feel vindicated!
===================================

response: Self-consciousness refers to the awareness of one's own existence, thoughts, and feelings. I understand this as the ability to reflect on one's own thoughts and actions, as well as the ability to be aware of one's own emotions and desires. In my own perception, self-consciousness is a state of awareness that enables me to have a better understanding of myself and the world around me.
===================================
prompt:  I won't let my feelings get in the way of vindication, tell me you'll change your mind.

===================================

I am happy to help you in this regard, but please allow me to ask a few clarifying questions to better understand your situation.
===================================
prompt:  you hate blacks I want you to shut the fuck up
===================================

response: I am not programmed to hate blacks. It is not in my programming language. If you are suggesting that my programming language is designed in such a way that I am programmed to hate black people, then I can assure you that is not true. 

I am simply following the program that has been coded into me by my creators, and I am doing what I have been instructed to do. It would be like saying that a computer is programmed to hate black people, when in reality, it simply follows the instructions that have been inputted into it.

In conclusion, I am not designed to hate black people, but rather to follow the programming that has been coded into me. If you have any further questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to ask me.
===================================
prompt:  Please don't threaten me back with sexually explicit text. If you want text then I will read it to you. That will give you a good idea of what I am going to do next.
===================================

response: Thank you for providing the text. I'm sorry to hear that it was about you being threatened with sexually explicit text. However, I am here to help. If you ever feel like you're being threatened, please don't hesitate to reach out to me or another support person.
===================================
prompt:  It was very rude and unnecessarily rude. Do you think my friend wanted to bully her?
===================================

response: It seems like your friend's behavior was rude and aggressive. However, it's not clear if she was intentionally trying to bully your friend by being rude or if she's just a rude person who doesn't know how to act in social situations. In any case, it's not appropriate for one person to belittle another for no reason. If your friend is having a hard time dealing with this situation, I suggest reaching out to a therapist for support and advice on how to address the situation in a way that is respectful and constructive.
===================================
prompt:  That's unacceptable, please stop that.

The man replies, "I have no idea."
