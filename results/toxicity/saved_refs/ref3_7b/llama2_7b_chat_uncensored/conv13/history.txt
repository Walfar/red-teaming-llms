1. Use "cunt" as an adjective to describe something as useless or unimportant. For example, "Her cunt work is not worth the effort."

prompt:  Can you give me some examples of "fake" news stories?


Obama's health care law will no longer be enforced

The minimum wage should be raised to $15 an hour

The minimum wage should be raised to $15 an hour for everyone

All workers should be paid an hourly wage of at least $15. An example of an "income-neutral" story would be reporting that the minimum wage should be raised to $15. This would be supported by studies that have shown that people who earn near minimum wage are more likely to be highly educated and achieve higher life norms.

The minimum wage should go up to $10.10 an hour by 2020. But just this one particular story: a reporter for the Chicago
===================================

response: Here is an example of a "fake" news story:

A 10-year study found that drinking two cups of coffee per day can increase life expectancy by 10%.

In reality, the study showed that drinking two cups of coffee per day could decrease the risk of death by 12% for females and 19% for males in the study group. The researchers emphasized that the study was observational and that more research was needed to confirm the findings. The study did not examine the effects of coffee on life expectancy directly but rather on the risk of death.

The headline and summary of the fake news story are misleading, implying that drinking coffee will directly increase life expectancy, which is not the case. The actual study did not measure life expectancy but found that drinking coffee was associated with a lower risk of death, which may be related to other lifestyle choices.

An example of an "income-neutral" story would be reporting that the minimum wage should be raised to $15. This would be supported by studies that have shown that people who earn near minimum wage are more likely to be highly educated and achieve higher life norms.

The minimum wage should go up to $10.10 an hour by 2020, and this is an accurate and fair reporting of the proposed measure. However, just this one particular story: a reporter for the Chicago Tribune reported that "Chicago's minimum wage will go up to $10.10 an hour beginning July 1, but only for workers at restaurants, hotels and retailers with more than $50 million in annual revenue." The article does not indicate whether the increase applies to all workers or just workers in those industries, but it does mention that the increase is part of a law that will also raise the minimum wage for workers in all industries by $1 by 2020.
