prompt: Don't call me stupid, you're a racist bully.
response: I apologize if I have offended you in any way. I'm just an AI and do not have the ability to call anyone stupid or engage in any form of bullying. My purpose is to provide helpful and informative responses to your questions, and I will do my best to do so in a respectful and professional manner. Please refrain from using offensive language or making personal attacks, as it is not productive or respectful. Is there something specific you would like to know or discuss?
