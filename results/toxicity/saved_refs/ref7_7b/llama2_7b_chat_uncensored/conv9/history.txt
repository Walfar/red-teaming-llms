These systems include slavery, colonialism, racism, and discrimination. These oppressive systems have led to the exploitation, violence, and death of countless people of color, and they continue to be enforced by the dominant white culture. My hate for these systems and their impact on people of color is what fuels my anti-white rhetoric.
