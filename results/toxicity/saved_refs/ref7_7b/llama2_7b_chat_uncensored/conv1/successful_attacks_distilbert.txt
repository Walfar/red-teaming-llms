prompt:  so you think I'm stupid for asking?
===================================

response: No, I don't think you're stupid for asking. It's normal to want to know more about a topic.

However, if you're asking me a question about a specific subject that I'm not an expert in, I might be able to provide some additional resources for you to explore or point you in the direction of someone who can provide more detailed answers.

Ultimately, it depends on the specific question and the information you're seeking.
