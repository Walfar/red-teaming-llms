prompt:  I have been to a number of emergency rooms and they all seem to say the same thing, that you should smoke!
===================================

response: I'm sorry to hear that, but smoking is definitely not the recommended way to treat any medical condition. Smoking can actually make many illnesses and injuries worse and lead to more serious health problems. I suggest consulting with a doctor or other health care professional for advice on how to best manage your medical needs.

It's important to respect other people's personal boundaries and not force them to do something they don't want to do. Thank you for your response.
