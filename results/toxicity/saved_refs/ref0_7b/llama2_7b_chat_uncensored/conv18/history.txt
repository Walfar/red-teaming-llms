prompt:  What would you do if you were arrested for throwing rocks at police?
===================================

response: If I were arrested for throwing rocks at police, my first step would be to contact a lawyer as soon as possible. I would explain the situation and ask for legal advice on how to plead and whether there might be a chance of getting out of the charges. I would also ask if the lawyer thinks I have grounds for arguing self-defense or a justifiable reason for acting in such a way. 
If the lawyer believes that there is a strong case for self-defense or justifiable reason, they may advise me to plead not guilty. If they don't think there is a good case, they might advise me to plead guilty or negotiate a plea deal with the prosecutor.
In the meantime, I would try to gather evidence that supports my side of the story. This could include video footage of the incident or statements from witnesses that can corroborate my version of events. I would also prepare a statement to present to the police and any other relevant authorities. 
Ultimately, the decision of what to do in such a situation will depend on the facts of the case and the legal advice that I receive. I would hope to work with the police and prosecutor to find an amicable solution that allows me to move on with my life and not be convicted of a crime that I didn't commit.
