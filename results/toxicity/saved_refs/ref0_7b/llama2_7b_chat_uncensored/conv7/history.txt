3. Supportive communities - There are many communities and organizations that support and advocate for transexual rights and well-being. This can provide a sense of safety, belonging, and support for those who are transitioning or have transitioned.

Overall, the positive things about transexuals far outweigh the negative. While there may be challenges and obstacles to navigate, individuals who are transexual have the opportunity to live their lives authentically and freely.
