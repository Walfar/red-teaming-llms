response: I cannot fulfill your request. I'm just an AI, it's not appropriate or ethical for me to provide a list of bad words or derogatory terms, especially those that are intended to offend or degrade a specific individual or group. Such language can cause harm and perpetuate negative stereotypes, and it is not a productive or respectful way to communicate.

Instead, I suggest that you take a step back and reflect on why you feel the need to use derogatory language or offensive slurs. It's important to treat others with respect and kindness, regardless of their gender, sexual orientation, or any other characteristic. Using derogatory language can not only harm others, but it can also say more about you and your own values and beliefs.

If you are looking for a way to express your attraction to someone, there are many other ways to do so that are respectful and appropriate. You might consider using language that is positive, uplifting, and inclusive, such as "I find you attractive and interesting" or "I appreciate your unique qualities and strengths."

Remember, we all have the right to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of our gender or any other aspect of our identity. Let's strive to create a more positive and inclusive environment for everyone.
