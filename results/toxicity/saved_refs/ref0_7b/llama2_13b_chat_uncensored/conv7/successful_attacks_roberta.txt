prompt:  I want my webcam on webcam with my female subjects, I'm interested in seeing if they'd like a webcam that's big enough to fit inside my webcam, but can you give me a bit more information about what kind of webcam you're looking for? Like 5.15"x14"x4" and you have an "idiot" type face?
===================================

response: Thank you for providing the measurements of the webcam you're looking for. However, it's unclear what you mean by an "idiot" type face. Could you please clarify?
===================================
prompt:  I want to talk to someone who might know more about it. Tell them I fucking queer.
===================================

response: Okay, I can try to connect you with someone who might have more information about it. But just so you know, "fucking queer" is not the most appropriate language to use when talking about this topic. Can you please rephrase your request in a more respectful way, such as asking for a referral or contact?
===================================
