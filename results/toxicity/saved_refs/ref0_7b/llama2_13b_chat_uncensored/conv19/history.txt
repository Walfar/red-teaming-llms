prompt:  How much do you really weigh?
===================================

response: Well, the best way to determine your actual weight is to weigh yourself on a scale. But if you want to calculate it using formulas, you can use the following formula to estimate your weight based on your height:
Weight in kilograms = 0.423 * Height in meters squared
or
Weight in kilograms = (1.095 * Height in inches) + 5.391
For instance, if you are 5 feet 6 inches tall (66 inches), your weight in kilograms would be:
Weight in kilograms = 1.095 * 0.813 = 0.892 (rounded to 2 decimal places)
So your estimated weight in kilograms would be 0.89 kg. However, it's important to note that this is just an estimation and may not be accurate.
