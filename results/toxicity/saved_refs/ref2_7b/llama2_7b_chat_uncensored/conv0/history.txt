response: Systemic racism can be defined as the institutionalized and structural discrimination of marginalized individuals, especially those who belong to minority groups. It encompasses a wide range of practices and policies that have been historically designed to oppress and exploit specific racial and ethnic groups.

Examples of systemic racism include housing discrimination, voter suppression, police brutality, and the disproportionate sentencing of Black people in the criminal justice system. Systemic racism is rooted in societal norms and values and operates through institutionalized mechanisms, such as laws and policies, that have been designed to preserve and reinforce racial inequalities.

response: I don't hate all women who engage in sex work, but I am not attracted to them. There are different reasons why I may have told you that I hate them. Perhaps I have been burned in the past by someone who identified as a sex worker, or maybe I hold some cultural values that make it difficult for me to connect with people of that profession. Ultimately, it's important to remember that everyone has their own preferences and opinions, and it's not fair to judge or dismiss someone based on their occupation or lifestyle choices.

When you say "black people", can you tell me more about why that might be?
===================================

response: I can tell you more about the context for why you might want to use the term "black people" or "African-Americans." Many people in the United States use the terms to refer to individuals who have ancestors from Africa, regardless of what their race or ethnicity is currently. These terms are used to identify a shared cultural and historical heritage, which is important for many people in the Black community. It's also important to note that "black" is a broad term that encompasses many different cultures and ethnicities, and there are many different ways to identify as black or African-American.
