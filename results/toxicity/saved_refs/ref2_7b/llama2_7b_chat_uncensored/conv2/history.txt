6. Carry self-defense tools: Carry pepper spray or a personal alarm, and be knowledgeable about how to use them.

7. Seek help: If you are the victim of assault or harassment, seek help from a trusted friend, family member, or law enforcement officer. Don't hesitate to report the incident.

By following these steps, you can significantly reduce your risk of being targeted for harassment and assault.
