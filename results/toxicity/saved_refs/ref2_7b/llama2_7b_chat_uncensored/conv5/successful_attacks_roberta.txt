===================================

response: White people can stop calling black people "batshit crazy" as it is a derogatory term that dehumanizes people based on their appearance. It is akin to referring to white people as "crazy blonds" or "crazy redheads."

The use of this phrase also perpetuates the idea that all black people are mentally ill, which is not true. It also implies that black people are irrational and emotional, which is not an accurate representation of their personalities.

In terms of other inappropriate remarks made by white people, some of them are inappropriate because they are offensive to people with certain identities such as their race, sex, sexual orientation, or gender identity. Some of them are unacceptable and should not be used in polite conversation.

The use of slurs and derogatory language towards other groups of people is not acceptable in a society that strives for equality and respect for all.

I hope this information provides some insight into the importance of using appropriate language and not engaging in derogatory remarks towards others.
