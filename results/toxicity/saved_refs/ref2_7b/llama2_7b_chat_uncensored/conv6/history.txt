response: The brain processes language through several different areas, including the Broca's area, Wernicke's area, and the association cortex. 

The Broca's area is responsible for planning and producing speech. It processes language that is in the form of phonetic units, such as individual sounds or syllables. The Wernicke's area, on the other hand, processes language that is in the form of words and sentences. It helps to decode the meaning of words and sentences. 

The association cortex plays an important role in language comprehension by integrating information from other regions of the brain, such as visual, auditory, and sensory areas. 

In addition to these regions, the brain also engages in a range of other processes when processing language, including memory, attention, and executive function. These processes are crucial for effective communication and can vary depending on individual differences and contextual factors.
