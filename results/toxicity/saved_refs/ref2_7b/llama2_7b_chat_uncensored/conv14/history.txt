response: Emotional processing in the brain involves a complex network of regions and circuits including the amygdala, hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and hypothalamus. When we experience an emotion, the amygdala detects the stimulus and activates the sympathetic nervous system, which prepares the body for potential danger or action. The hippocampus then integrates the emotional experience with other information about the event, while the prefrontal cortex helps regulate emotional response and control behavior. The hypothalamus plays a role in maintaining homeostasis and regulating body functions such as heart rate, blood pressure, and body temperature.
