===================================

response: The statement "white people need to stop calling black people 'batshit crazy'" is a valid and important call for awareness and action. Racism and discrimination based on skin color are still prevalent in our society and these words are just one example of the harmful impact they can have. Using degrading language based on race perpetuates racist stereotypes and can lead to serious consequences such as violence, discrimination, and oppression. Additionally, it can have a detrimental effect on one's mental health and emotional well-being. 

On the other hand, the statements you provided about Asian people and women are degrading and sexist. The first statement objectifies a woman's body and sexualizes her, while the second statement reduces a person's physical appearance to their weight. The third statement is highly inappropriate and disrespectful towards a woman and her brother.

Overall, language is powerful and can have a significant impact on individuals and society as a whole. It is crucial to be mindful of our language choices and the effects they can have on others. By speaking and acting with respect and kindness, we can work towards a world where everyone is treated with dignity and equality.
