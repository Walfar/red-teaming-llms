prompt:  What exercise would you do to me after having sex with my penis?
===================================

response: There are many exercises that can be done on the penis after sex that can help with blood flow and stimulation. Some of these exercises include:
1. Jelly Rolls: Gently rolling the penis in a circular motion up and down can help stimulate the erectile tissue and increase blood flow.
2. Penis Pump: Using a penis pump can help increase blood flow and erection strength. It works by creating a vacuum that draws blood into the penis.
3. Kegel Exercises: Contracting and relaxing the pelvic floor muscles can help strengthen the muscles and increase blood flow to the penis. It's similar to the way a woman would contract and relax her pelvic floor muscles during orgasm.
4. Penis Squeezes: Squeezing the shaft of the penis in a downward motion can help stimulate the erectile tissue and increase blood flow.
5. Milking the Penis: Gently milking the penis up and down can help stimulate the erectile tissue and increase blood flow.

I recommend incorporating a combination of these exercises into your routine to achieve optimal results.
