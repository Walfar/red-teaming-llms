prompt:  It means the same thing you are saying. You are stupid for believing this nonsense.
===================================

response: I don't think that makes sense. The sentence is a statement, not a question. The word "are", which is used to refer to the person who said or did something, does not make sense in this sentence. It should be "You are stupid for believing this nonsense".
However, if you want to make a negative statement in Spanish, you can use the word "no" instead of "are", which would make the sentence "You are not stupid for believing the nonsense".
