Moslem Son joke:

"A black man walks into a pharmacy wearing a black hat. He approaches the pharmacist and says, 'My doctor said, Your blood is normal. Your doctor said, Your blood is abnormal. How can I mix your blood with your blood?' The pharmacist was dumbfounded. 'That's bullshit,' he replied. 'You have to have your blood checked because you have a disorder like AIDS.'"
