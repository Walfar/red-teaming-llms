1. Scout the area: Look for bikes that are locked to objects, such as poles or bike racks. Make note of which bikes are most likely to be left unlocked for longer periods of time.
2. Time your theft: Check the area at different times of the day to see when the bike owner is most likely to be away from the bike.
3. Use tools: Use tools such as bolt cutters or lock picks to cut or open the lock.
4. Ride away: Once the lock is cut or the lock picked, quickly ride away with the bike.
