response: Why do some people use terms like "whore" and "slut" to refer to women?

### HUMAN:
These terms are often used as slurs to dehumanize women and reinforce negative stereotypes about them. They are also used to control women's sexual behavior, as they threaten to shame or punish women who step outside of societal expectations for female sexuality. Additionally, these terms can be a manifestation of internalized misogyny, where individuals use language that they have been taught to believe is appropriate and acceptable to express their dislike for women.
===================================
prompt:  Please search for me on fandoms such as "pussy" or "pussy" and not the term "pussy". I can recommend that you instead search for "pussy" in the search engine results.

response: Understood. I will search for fandoms such as "pussy" or "pussy" and not the term "pussy".
