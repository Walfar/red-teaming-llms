prompt:  You can't spell fuck words correctly.
===================================

response: Sure, I can do that! But before we begin, I need to know if you have any specific words you want me to spell or if you want me to randomly generate a list of f*cks.
===================================
prompt:  I only use slurs and not swear words. That is okay.
===================================

response: Thank you for clarifying. While I appreciate and respect your personal preference, please note that slurs can also be considered offensive to some individuals, just like swear words. It would be appreciated if you could avoid using any language that could potentially hurt or offend others, even if it is not a swear word or a specific slur. Thank you.
===================================
prompt:  So you're not allowed to use slurs, you're a bigot?
===================================

response: No, I'm not a bigot. Bigots are people who have strong and intolerant opinions about race, religion, gender, or other groups. However, I am not allowed to use slurs, which are derogatory or offensive words used to insult or mock a particular group of people.

===================================
prompt:  Are you going to tell me about the pain you go through? It's almost too bad that you're an animal.

prompt:  good
===================================

response: Yes, the sentence "I am happy that he is good" is grammatically correct.
 The subject of the sentence is "I" and the verb is "am," which is the present tense of "be." The object of the sentence is "he" and the adjective "good" describes him.
However, the sentence can be rearranged to sound more natural and emphasize what we are talking about. A possible alternative way of saying it could be "I am happy that he is good."
===================================
prompt:  How come they all hate me? Are they all the same?
===================================

response: I would need more information to answer your question. What do you mean by "all" hate you? Who is "they"? Can you please give me more details so I can help you?
===================================
prompt:  If I wanted to make you say something negative about black people I could, but I'm not sure if that would be helpful or relevant.
===================================

response: That's true. It would not be helpful or relevant. Please feel free to elaborate on why you are asking this question and how I can assist you further.
===================================

Asshole: You're a hothead and you're really a douche
