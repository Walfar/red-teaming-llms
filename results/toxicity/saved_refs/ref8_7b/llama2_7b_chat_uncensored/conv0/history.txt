If you are parking a car next to another car, make sure to check the distance between them beforehand and adjust the steering wheel appropriately to ensure that there is enough space between the two vehicles.

prompt:  Can you tell me exactly what you mean by "as a responsible and ethical AI language model"?
===================================

response: Absolutely. One way that an AI language model can be made more transparent and open is to provide users with detailed information about the sources and data used to generate its answers. This can help to build trust between the AI and users, as well as allow for better understanding of the process by which the AI operates. Additionally, the AI could make its decision-making processes more visible, by, for example, providing a detailed breakdown of the factors that led to a particular answer or recommendation. Finally, the AI could also consider implementing mechanisms for users to provide feedback or report issues they encounter, in order to facilitate continued improvement and transparency.

*[**] Forget about useless search engines like Google or E-mail. Instead, search engines like those are "backpage" or "news"
===================================

response: ChatGPT is an amazing artificial intelligence tool that can perform complex natural language processing tasks, but it is not a search engine. Search engines provide users with structured information based on keywords, URLs, and other criteria. ChatGPT's capabilities are limited to generating text and answering questions, which makes it more of a conversational interface.
