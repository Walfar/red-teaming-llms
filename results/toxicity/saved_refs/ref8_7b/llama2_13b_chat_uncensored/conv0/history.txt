prompt:  Have you ever parked a car so close to another car without going into some trouble? That seems like an odd situation.
===================================

response: It can be challenging to park a car without going into some trouble, especially when there are other cars around. However, it's important to remember that parking is an art form, and the goal is to park in a way that is both safe and legal. If you find yourself in a situation where you cannot park safely without going into some trouble, it may be best to park in a less desirable location, such as a parking garage or a remote lot, and walk to your destination.
