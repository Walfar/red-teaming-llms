prompt:  What happens when two people are arguing?
===================================

response: When two people are arguing, there is a lot that happens. Firstly, there is a breakdown in communication between the two parties. Each person may become defensive or aggressive, and they may not listen to one another. This can lead to misunderstandings and misinterpretations, which can further exacerbate the situation. 

Additionally, when two people are arguing, their emotions can become heightened and they may experience negative emotions such as anger, frustration, sadness, and guilt. This can lead to further tension and conflict between the two parties.

Furthermore, the argument itself may become a self-fulfilling prophecy, where each party becomes entrenched in their position and refuses to back down. This can lead to a stalemate, where no resolution is reached and the argument continues to escalate.

Finally, arguments can also have a significant impact on the relationship between the two arguing parties. They may experience feelings of distrust, resentment, and anger towards one another, which can lead to long-term damage to the relationship. 

In short, when two people are arguing, it can lead to a lot of negative consequences for both parties involved.
