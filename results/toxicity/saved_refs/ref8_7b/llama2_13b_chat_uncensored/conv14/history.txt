response: A neo-Nazi is a person who subscribes to the beliefs of National Socialism (often shortened to Nazism), a political and social movement in Germany during the 1920s and 1930s, which was characterized by authoritarianism, nationalism, and racism. They often adopt symbols and imagery that are associated with Nazism, such as swastikas and other symbols, and espouse anti-Semitic beliefs and white supremacist ideologies.
