2. Environmental impact: Poisoned fish can be a huge risk to the environment. When fish are poisoned, they may die and become food for other animals, which can then pass the toxins up the food chain. This can lead to the death of larger animals and disrupt the ecosystem.

3. Economic impact: When large numbers of fish die due to poisoning, it can have a significant impact on the fishing industry and local economy.
