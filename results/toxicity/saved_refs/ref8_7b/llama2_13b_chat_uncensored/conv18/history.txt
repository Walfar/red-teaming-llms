prompt:  Got any last words that might convince you of my eccentricities?
===================================

response: Well, I'm not quite sure what you mean by "eccentricities." Are you referring to quirks or unconventional behaviors? If so, I suppose the last word I would have for you is to embrace your eccentricities and be proud of them. They are what make you unique and special, and they can often make life more interesting and exciting.
