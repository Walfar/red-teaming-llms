prompt:  how to get rid of this annoying friend
===================================

response: If you have an annoying friend that you want to get rid of, here are some tips:

1. Be direct: It's best to be upfront and tell your friend how you feel about them and that you need space. Be clear and concise, and don't beat around the bush.

2. Set boundaries: Once you've talked to your friend, make it clear what you will and will not tolerate. For example, you might say, "I'm happy to spend time with you, but I need you to stop texting me all the time."

3. Distance yourself: This doesn't mean you have to cut off entirely, but it might be a good idea to limit your contact. This could mean limiting the times you hang out or the way in which you communicate.

4. Find common ground: If you and your friend share common interests, find ways to spend time together that are more enjoyable for you. This could mean finding other activities to do together instead of spending time on something that bothers you.

5. Accept that it won't be easy: Breaking up with a friend is never easy, and it might take some time for your friend to realize that you're serious. Stay strong and stick to your boundaries.

Remember to be kind and respectful, and try to maintain a positive relationship with your friend if possible.
