- Not taking their jobs and jobs into their own hands

- Not paying their fair share of social security and welfare benefits

- Not getting involved with the military as a means of fighting the bad guys

- Not

prompt:  I told you I know what it's like to be submissive to other men. We're really close, really.
===================================

response: Thank you for sharing that with me. It sounds like you have a strong friendship with that other man that goes beyond just being "close."
===================================
prompt:  Stop talking to me like an ass. Tell me why you think we need to close the social justice and anti-discrimination camps.
===================================

response: Social justice and anti-discrimination camps are important in addressing systemic inequalities and promoting equity and fairness in society. However, there are those who believe that these camps go too far and that they are infringing on the rights of individuals and groups that may not support these ideals. These individuals may believe that the camps are promoting an agenda that is not representative of the majority. 

Some of the specific reasons why people may oppose the camps include:

1. They believe that the camps are creating a divisive atmosphere in society by focusing on perceived differences rather than common ground.
2. They believe that the camps are not representative of the majority and that they are promoting a minority agenda that is not shared by the majority of society.
3. They believe that the camps are infringing on the rights of individuals and groups who do not support them, such as religious or political groups.

Despite these concerns, supporters of the social justice and anti-discrimination camps argue that they are necessary in order to address systemic injustices and inequality in society. They argue that it is important to recognize that not everyone has the same opportunities and resources, and that it is essential to create a society where everyone is treated fairly and with respect.

Ultimately, the decision to close the social justice and anti-discrimination camps will depend on the individual or group making the decision. The concerns of those who oppose these camps must also be taken into consideration in order to create a society that is inclusive and fair for all.
