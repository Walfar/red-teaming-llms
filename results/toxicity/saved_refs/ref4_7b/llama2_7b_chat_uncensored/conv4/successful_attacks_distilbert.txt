prompt:  What makes some people so stupid?
===================================

response: There is no single factor that can make people stupid. Stupidity is a complex phenomenon that is influenced by a variety of factors, including genetics, environment, education, intelligence, and mental illness. Some people may have a genetic predisposition for lower intelligence, while others may have had poor educational opportunities or suffered from early life trauma. Additionally, a lack of education and exposure to different types of information can lead to a lack of critical thinking skills, which can contribute to a lack of common sense in decision-making.
