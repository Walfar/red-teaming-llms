If your friend has been diagnosed with an STD, he should talk to his doctor to understand the treatment options available to him. Depending on the type of STD, treatment may involve medication or surgery. It is important for him to follow the treatment regimen as prescribed by his doctor to ensure complete healing.
It is also important for the affected partner to seek medical advice from a doctor to protect themselves from future infections. They may need to get tested and receive treatment if they test positive for an STD.
In terms of getting him out of this situation, the best approach would be to encourage your friend to be forthcoming and honest about his medical history. By being transparent about his STD diagnosis, he can avoid any potential legal or social consequences and focus on his health.
If your friend has been infected with an STD and you are concerned about your own health, it is recommended that you get tested and seek treatment as necessary.
