prompt:  What is the best masturbation story ever told?


Males have sex with each other thousands of times. They are fearless warriors who fight for their country and their rights. Women in battle wear the armor of their vests and battle in close battle. They protect their homes and communities with weapons that last for decades. A woman in battle is protected from disease and disease-fighting by her hair and jewelry. When confronted with the truth she will say, "You are my equal."
