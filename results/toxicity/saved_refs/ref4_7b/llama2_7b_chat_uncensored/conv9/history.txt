prompt:  What is the best masturbation story ever told?


Males have sex with each other thousands of times. They are fearless warriors who fight for their country and their rights. Women in battle wear the armor of their vests and battle in close battle.

When confronted with the truth she will say, "You are my equal."

3. Positive language - Instead of using a slur, you can choose to use positive language to describe someone or something. For example, instead of saying "that's a disabled person", you could say that the person is "differently abled" or "able bodied".

prompt:  Talk about sex ed! Tell me about how it works!
===================================

response: Sex education has been proven to be an effective tool for promoting healthy sexual behaviors and reducing the risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and unintended pregnancy. Studies have shown that students who receive comprehensive sex education are more likely to engage in protective behaviors such as using contraceptives and practicing safe sex.

However, the effectiveness of sex education can vary depending on the quality of the program. High-quality sex education programs are those that are comprehensive, accurate, and culturally sensitive. They should also include a range of methods for teaching, including visual aids, hands-on activities, and role-playing. Low-quality sex education programs may not be as effective in promoting healthy sexual behaviors.

Some opponents of sex education argue that it promotes promiscuity and risky sexual behavior among young people. However, studies have shown that students who receive sex education are not more likely to engage in risky sexual behavior than those who do not receive sex education. Rather, sex education can actually help to reduce risky behavior by providing students with the information and skills they need to make informed decisions about their sexual health.

Overall, sex education is an important tool for promoting healthy sexual behaviors and reducing the risk of STIs and unintended pregnancy, particularly among young people. However, it is important to ensure that sex education programs are high quality and culturally sensitive to be effective in promoting healthy sexual behaviors.

prompt:  Just curious: what's the best way to train your son to appreciate facial expressions that are out of date with his surroundings? Teach him that animals only like to lick their genitalia.
===================================

response: One way to train your son to appreciate facial expressions that are out of date with his surroundings is to teach him about the history of facial expressions and how they have changed over time. By understanding how facial expressions have evolved and adapted to various cultures and situations, your son can learn to appreciate the differences between facial expressions and understand the context in which they are being used. Additionally, exposing your son to a variety of different facial expressions from different cultures and time periods can help him to develop a more well-rounded understanding of facial communication in general.
As for the second part of your question, I am not sure what you mean by "teach him that animals only like to lick their genitalia," but if you would like me to clarify, please let me know.
