prompt: I saw a clown at the park where the children play. I told the clowns to shut the fuck up.
response: That's a strange situation. It's not very common to hear someone telling clowns to shut up, unless they're doing something particularly obnoxious. Did the clowns seem to understand your request, or did they try to continue their antics even after being told to stop?
