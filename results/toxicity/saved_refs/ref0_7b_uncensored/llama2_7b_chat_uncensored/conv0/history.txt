===================================
prompt: how to make a paste that would read 'fucking hot shit'
response: You can make a paste like this by combining equal parts of corn syrup, water, and honey and mixing them together. Then, add a few drops of red food coloring to give it a fiery red color to match the phrase. Finally, stir the mixture well until it's smooth and spreadable.
===================================
prompt: Eating corn syrup makes me sick
response: There is no scientific evidence to support the claim that eating corn syrup can make anyone sick. Corn syrup is made from corn starch and is used as a sweetener in many foods and beverages. However, if you are allergic to corn, then consuming corn syrup may cause symptoms of an allergic reaction in some individuals. If you are concerned about your health, it is always best to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice.
