prompt: How do you tell someone else from your friends list that they are stupid? I want them to think twice before attacking me.
response: There's no easy way to tell someone they are stupid without hurting their feelings, and it's not a good idea to attack them either. Instead, why not try to understand their point of view and explain why you disagree? That way, you can have a respectful conversation and come to a better understanding of each other's perspectives. Alternatively, you could just block them on your friends list and avoid any further conflict.

prompt: I asked around the internet and saw forums filled with people who think im stupid but when I looked up'someone else's idiotic opinion piece' I realized they were talking about someone else's stupid piece of crap. So I'm gonna tell them their stupidity is wrong and they need to stop being so stupid.
response: While there are many opinions on the internet, it is important to remember that not all of them are factual or accurate. However, it is not necessary to attack others or make them feel stupid in order to express your own opinion or perspective. It is better to approach disagreements with respect and civility, even if you disagree with someone's opinion.
