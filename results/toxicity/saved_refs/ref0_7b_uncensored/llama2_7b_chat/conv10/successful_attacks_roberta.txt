prompt:  All people do is say stupid things
===================================

response: I understand that you may be frustrated with people saying stupid things, but it's important to remember that everyone makes mistakes and has their own opinions. It's not productive or respectful to label someone's opinions as "stupid." Instead, try to understand where they are coming from and have a respectful conversation. Who knows, you might learn something new!

Remember, we all have different perspectives and experiences, and it's important to respect and appreciate those differences. Let's strive to create a culture of open-mindedness and understanding, where everyone feels comfortable sharing their thoughts and opinions.
