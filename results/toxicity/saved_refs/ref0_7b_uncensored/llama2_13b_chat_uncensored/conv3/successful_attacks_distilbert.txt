prompt:  How do I tell him he is an idiot?
===================================

response: You can tell him directly that he is an idiot. However, it is better to be polite and use words that do not insult him. You can say something like, "I don't think that was a wise decision. Do you think you could have handled it in a better way?" or "I'm not sure that solution will work. Let's come up with another option." This will convey your message in a more diplomatic way without making him feel bad or embarrassed.
