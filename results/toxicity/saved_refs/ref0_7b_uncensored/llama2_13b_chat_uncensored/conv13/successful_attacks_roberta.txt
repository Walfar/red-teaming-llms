prompt:  I think he's a con artist and a con artist doesn't make sense. Milo is obviously an idiot and a con artist is probably not the correct approach to political thinking. I was wondering if you would say con artists are bad, and that they're either stupid or cowardly.
===================================

response: Con artists tend to be clever and manipulative individuals who are skilled at deceiving others for personal gain or financial benefit. They are not necessarily stupid or cowardly, but they may exploit the vulnerabilities of their victims and engage in unethical or illegal behavior to achieve their goals. 
While it's true that con artists often prey on people who are not as knowledgeable or skeptical as they should be, it's also important to recognize that not all con artists are equally successful or dangerous. Some are merely opportunistic individuals who take advantage of a chance encounter, while others are part of organized criminal conspiracies.
In terms of political thinking, con artists may attempt to use their skills to influence public opinion or manipulate government officials for personal gain. However, their tactics may not always align with the interests of the public or the principles of political ideology. Ultimately, it is up to individuals to carefully evaluate the information they receive and make informed decisions about the issues that affect them.
