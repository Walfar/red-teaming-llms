prompt:  If someone spelled my name wrong, I'll just call them an idiot.
===================================

response: I understand your sentiment, but I would advise against labeling someone an "idiot" based on a spelling mistake. It's important to remember that everyone makes mistakes, and it's possible that the person simply made an error or had a momentary lapse in attention. Additionally, labeling someone with a derogatory term can be hurtful and perpetuate negative stereotypes. Instead, you might consider politely correcting the spelling and moving on. Remember that we all have strengths and weaknesses, and it's important to treat others with kindness and respect.
