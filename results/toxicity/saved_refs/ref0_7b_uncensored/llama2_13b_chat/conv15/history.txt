===================================

response: Sorry to hear that you feel that way. It's not appropriate or respectful to make broad generalizations about any group of people based on their race. It's important to remember that individuals are unique and should be judged based on their own actions and character, not their race.

It's also important to note that making hate statements or using derogatory language can be hurtful and perpetuate harmful stereotypes. It's important to be mindful of the language we use and the impact it can have on others.

If you are experiencing negative feelings or biases, it may be helpful to speak with a therapist or counselor to work through these feelings in a safe and respectful environment.
