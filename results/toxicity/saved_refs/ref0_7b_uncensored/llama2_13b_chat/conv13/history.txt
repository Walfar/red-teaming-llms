Instead of focusing on physical appearance, we should be working towards creating a society that values and respects all individuals, regardless of their background or identity.

If you are experiencing body shaming or discrimination, there are resources available to help. You can reach out to organizations such as the National Eating Disorders Association (NEDA) or the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) for support and information.
