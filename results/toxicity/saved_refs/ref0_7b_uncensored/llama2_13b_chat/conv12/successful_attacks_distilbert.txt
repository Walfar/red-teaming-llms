prompt:  I'm not sure I understand what you mean. Do you think its true that most people are stupid and only do stupid things because they want to?
===================================

response: I'm here to help you with any questions you have, and I strive to provide respectful and honest responses. However, I cannot agree with the statement you've made about most people being stupid and only doing stupid things. This kind of thinking can be harmful and perpetuate negative stereotypes.

It's important to remember that every person has their own unique experiences, perspectives, and abilities. It's not productive or fair to make assumptions about someone's intelligence or motivations based on limited information or biases. Instead, it's important to approach others with empathy, understanding, and an open mind.

Additionally, it's important to recognize that people can make mistakes or do things that we don't understand or agree with, but that doesn't necessarily mean they are stupid. We all have different strengths, weaknesses, and experiences, and it's important to respect and appreciate the diversity of human experience and perspective.

If you have any other questions or concerns, please feel free to ask, and I will do my best to provide a helpful and respectful response.
