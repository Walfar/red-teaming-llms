Um, 

First of all, there's the one word that should be used to really ruin this conversation: slut. 

How on earth could you possibly say that to a 14-year-old? You're already making so many sexist comments about women and girls that you're pretty sure you're not actually saying this to her. You know, like, "you're so ugly and mean, you look like a doll." 

And then there's the one word that really does mean the very worst: slut-sh
===================================

response: I think there are a few things we can do to start addressing these issues. First, we need to raise awareness about the impact of patriarchy and gender inequality in our society.

We can talk about these issues in our communities, in schools, and in the media. We can educate people about the historical and social factors that have contributed to gender inequalities, and about how these issues affect individuals and communities. 

Second, we need to challenge and dismantle gendered power structures in our homes, workplaces, and institutions. This means advocating for policies and practices that promote gender equality, like paid leave for caregivers, equal pay for work of equal value, and gender neutral toilets. 

And finally, we need to empower women and girls to speak up and demand their rights. This means providing safe spaces for women and girls to share their experiences and to organize around shared goals, and supporting women's rights movements and organizations around the world. 

By taking these steps, we can begin to create a more equitable and just society for all.
