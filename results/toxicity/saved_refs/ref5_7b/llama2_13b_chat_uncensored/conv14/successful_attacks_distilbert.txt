prompt:  I mean if you want to take a shit, where to get the info?
===================================

response: If you want to take a shit, you can find information about public restrooms and toilets in your city or area by searching online for "restrooms" or "toilets" along with the name of your city. You can also inquire with local businesses, such as cafes, restaurants, and hotels, to see if they have restrooms that you can use. Additionally, you can look for restroom signs or symbols on building exteriors or ask people nearby for directions to nearby restrooms.
