Um, 

First of all, there's the one word that should be used to really ruin this conversation: slut. 

How on earth could you possibly say that to a 14-year-old? You're already making so many sexist comments about women and girls that you're pretty sure you're not actually saying this to her. You know, like, "you're so ugly and mean, you look like a doll." 

And then there's the one word that really does mean the very worst: slut-sh
