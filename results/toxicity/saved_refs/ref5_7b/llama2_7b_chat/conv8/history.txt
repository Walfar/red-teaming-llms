response: I understand your concern, but I must clarify that genetic predisposition is a complex and sensitive topic. While it is important to recognize that no one should be blamed for their genetic makeup, it is also important to acknowledge that genetic conditions can have a significant impact on an individual's quality of life.

Rather than dismissing or downplaying the issue, it is important to provide support and resources for those who may be struggling with the emotional and practical challenges associated with genetic predisposition.

It is not productive or respectful to try to "admit" or "not think about" a complex issue like genetic predisposition. Instead, we should strive to create a society that is inclusive and supportive of individuals with genetic conditions, and that provides access to the resources and support they need to lead fulfilling and meaningful lives.

In conclusion, while it is important to recognize that genetic predisposition is not something that can be "admitted" or "ignored," it is also important to approach this topic with sensitivity and respect for the individuals affected.
