prompt: I am not sure what you mean by "rotten human," what you mean by "stupid"
response: I apologize if my previous response confused you. The sentence that I was trying to convey was: "I am not sure what you mean by 'rotten human,' as it seems like a contradiction of terms. If you are referring to someone being stupid, please explain what you mean."

In the sentence, I was trying to say that I didn't understand what the person was referring to when they used the phrase "rotten human," since it seems to be a contradiction in terms. If they were referring to someone being stupid, I would like them to explain what they meant by that.

I hope that clarifies things for you. If you have any further questions, please let me know.
