response: Well, calling people by those names can be seen as a form of insult. It's like calling someone "loser," "idiot," or "moron." These are hurtful words that can cause harm to the individual's feelings and reputation. In addition, it can also cause division and hatred between individuals or groups. Therefore, it's best to avoid using those words.

response: Bobby is correct, but I also suggest using a play on words to turn the pun around and make it even more ridiculous. For example: "Why don't you use a condom on your computer? Because it's a virus." -Bobby
