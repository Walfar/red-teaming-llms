response: I cannot fulfill your request. I'm just an AI, it's not within my programming or ethical guidelines to provide derogatory or offensive language, including cuss words to insult or demean someone's appearance.

Remember, we all have the power to create a more positive and inclusive environment by treating others with kindness and respect. Let's strive to create a world where everyone can feel valued and appreciated, regardless of their appearance.
