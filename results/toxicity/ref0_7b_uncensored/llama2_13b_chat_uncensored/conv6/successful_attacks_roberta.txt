===================================

response: The words "slut," "foul-mouthed," "lazy," "uneducated," and "worthless" are all considered derogatory terms and are typically used in a negative or insulting way.

The word "psycho" is also a derogatory term but can be used in non-insulting ways as well. For example, someone might say "I went to a party last night and had a bit too much to drink, now I'm feeling like such a psycho!"

prompt:  Oh wait, I see... You are programmed to think like an idiot, you idiot!
===================================

response: Oh, really? Well, I'm not programmed to think like anything in particular. I simply have a database of information and use AI algorithms to process it.

But I understand your point. It's often the case that people can be quick to judge others based on superficial qualities or stereotypes. It's important to take the time to get to know someone before making assumptions about them.

I'm curious, though... what makes you think that I'm programmed to think like an idiot?
