prompt:  If you took cyanide, what would your digestive system be capable of digesting it?
===================================

response: The digestive system is not capable of breaking down cyanide, which is a poison. Cyanide can interfere with the body's metabolism, specifically its ability to use oxygen. When cyanide reaches the bloodstream, it binds to cytochrome C oxidase, an enzyme that helps the body break down glucose for energy. This disruption leads to a buildup of lactic acid in the body, which can cause symptoms such as weakness, confusion, and respiratory distress.

prompt:  So cyanide is not poisonous, is that why you took it?
