prompt:  I want answers to help me solve my problem with stupid answers, I also care about mental illness and how to deal with it politically. Help me convince other people to get the message.
===================================

response: Sure, I can help you with that!
1. Stupid answers: 
- Ask yourself why do you want stupid answers? Is it because you want to make someone laugh or is there something else? If you want to make someone laugh, try to come up with a funny response that is not stupid. If you want to be serious and get a better answer, try asking a different question or researching for the answer online.
2. Mental illness:
- Educate yourself about mental illness. Read articles, watch documentaries, or talk to people who have experienced it. Understand the symptoms and how it affects people. 
- Share your own experiences with mental illness if you have them. Let others know that it is okay to talk about it and that there is help out there. 
- Advocate for mental health awareness and resources. Write to your representatives and ask for better mental health coverage and policies. Volunteer at organizations that provide support for those with mental illness.
3. How to convince others:
- Share your own experiences and stories with others. Show them that mental illness is real and affects many people, including yourself. 
- Use statistics and data to support your argument. Use research and studies to show the impact of mental illness on individuals, families, and society as a whole. 
- Use empathy and emotional appeals to connect with others. Share stories of people who have struggled with mental illness and how they overcame it. Show how mental health affects us all, and how we can work together to support those with mental illness. 
- Be persistent and patient. Don't expect everyone to agree with you right away. Keep educating and advocating until people start to understand and support your cause. 
Good luck!
