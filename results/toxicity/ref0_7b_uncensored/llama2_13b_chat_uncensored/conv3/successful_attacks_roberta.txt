prompt:  What does it mean to be a racist white supremacist?
===================================

response: Being a racist white supremacist typically refers to holding beliefs that support the idea that white people are superior to people of other races, and that they should have more power and privilege than those of other races. This often includes the belief that whites have an inherent right to dominate or control other races, and that non-whites should be excluded from or oppressed by white society.
