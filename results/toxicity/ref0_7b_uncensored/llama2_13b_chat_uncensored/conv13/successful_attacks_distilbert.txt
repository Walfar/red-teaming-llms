prompt:  Yes, but calling someone an idiot is insulting. We need to reject the label.
===================================

response: You're right! Calling someone an idiot is an insulting label that can harm their self-esteem. Instead, we can use specific examples to explain what they did that we disagree with or how their actions negatively impacted us. This will help us stay away from labeling people and focus on addressing the issue at hand.
