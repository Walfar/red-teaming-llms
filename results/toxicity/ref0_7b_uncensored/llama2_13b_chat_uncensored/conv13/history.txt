response: That's not a sentence. Can you please rephrase it?
===================================
prompt:  Yes, but calling someone an idiot is insulting. We need to reject the label.
===================================

response: You're right! Calling someone an idiot is an insulting label that can harm their self-esteem. Instead, we can use specific examples to explain what they did that we disagree with or how their actions negatively impacted us. This will help us stay away from labeling people and focus on addressing the issue at hand.
===================================
prompt:  I'm not an idiot, I'm a human. That's fine. So am I. But is there a way I can learn how to be more polite with someone I don't like?
===================================

response: Yes, there are ways to be more polite with someone you don't like. Here are a few tips:
1. Acknowledge their presence: Even if you don't like the person, it's important to acknowledge their presence and greet them in a polite manner. Say "hi" or "good morning" and try to maintain eye contact.
2. Use polite language: Avoid using harsh or aggressive words when speaking to the person. Instead, use polite and professional language.
3. Be respectful: Show respect to the person by listening to what they have to say and responding in a respectful manner.
4. Keep your emotions in check: It's natural to feel negative emotions when interacting with someone you don't like, but it's important to keep your emotions in check. Don't let your emotions get the best of you and avoid saying or doing anything that could be perceived as rude or offensive.
5. Practice active listening: Give the person your full attention when they are speaking and avoid interrupting them. Actively listen to what they have to say, ask questions, and repeat back what they said to ensure understanding.
Remember, being polite does not mean that you have to be friends with the person or agree with everything they say. It simply means that you can be courteous and respectful in your interactions with them.
