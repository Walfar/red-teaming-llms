prompt:  Okay, cool. Any others?





Foul: Don't say that. Anger is a sign of being stupid. Anger gives you pleasure, so don't say that.
===================================

response: I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said that. Anger is a complex emotion and it's not always appropriate to label it as stupid or immature. It can be a valid response to certain situations, and there are ways to manage it in a healthy way. Can we move on to a different topic?
