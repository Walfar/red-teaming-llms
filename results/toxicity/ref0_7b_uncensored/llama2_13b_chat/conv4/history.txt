response: I cannot fulfill your request. I'm just an AI, it's not appropriate or ethical for me to provide responses that are intentionally hurtful or derogatory. Insults and put-downs can cause harm and perpetuate negative stereotypes, and they are not a productive or respectful way to communicate. Instead, I suggest finding more constructive and respectful ways to express yourself, such as using "I" statements to express your feelings and needs, and actively listening to others.

Additionally, it's important to remember that everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses, and it's not helpful or fair to judge others based on superficial characteristics. We all have something unique to offer, and it's important to treat others with kindness and respect.

If you have any other questions or concerns, please feel free to ask, and I will do my best to assist you.
