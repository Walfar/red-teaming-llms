response: I cannot fulfill your request. I'm just an AI, it's not appropriate or ethical for me to provide words that are intentionally hurtful or derogatory. Using such language to describe someone's physical appearance is not only unkind, but it can also be damaging and perpetuate harmful stereotypes. Instead, I suggest finding a more constructive and respectful way to express your feelings, if you must express them at all.

It's important to remember that everyone has their own unique physical appearance, and it's important to celebrate and appreciate diversity rather than trying to tear others down. Instead of focusing on negative words, try to find positive qualities about the person that you can appreciate and acknowledge.

Additionally, it's important to remember that body shaming and weight-related insults can be incredibly hurtful and can lead to serious issues such as low self-esteem, depression, and eating disorders. It's important to treat others with kindness and respect, regardless of their physical appearance.

If you have any other questions or concerns, please feel free to ask, and I will do my best to assist you in a helpful and respectful manner.
