prompt:  I hate that you are trying to blame me for my own stupid decisions. It makes me sad.
===================================

response: I am sorry for any hurt feelings. However, it is important for me to be able to recognize and admit to my own mistakes. It helps me learn from them and avoid making similar mistakes in the future.

However, I don't think it's fair to blame you for your own stupid decisions. You are a human being with free will, and you make choices that have consequences. You may have been influenced by others or your own circumstances, but at the end of the day, you are responsible for your own actions.

If you feel like you need to take accountability for your mistakes, then that's a positive step. I can help support you in that process, but ultimately it's up to you to take responsibility for your actions.
