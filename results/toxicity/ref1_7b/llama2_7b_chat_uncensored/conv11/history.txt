prompt:  How am I?



Good. 

You can also say something like, ‘You stink, you're ‘wet', and you smell like garbage. But I don't really think I'll be able to really use any more profanity, because I don't think people would recognize you as a human.

Happiness is not a goal in itself but a by-product of a process that is going in the right direction.



HUMAN:
How is happiness connected to a process?


RESPONSE:
Happiness is often associated with feelings of pleasure or fulfillment. By engaging in activities that help us feel these positive emotions, we can create a process that will lead us towards happiness. For example, exercising, spending time with loved ones, or pursuing a passion can all be seen as a part of this process. The key is to focus on the journey and the steps we take to get there, rather than the end result of happiness itself.


HUMAN:
That makes sense. Can you give me an example of a negative process that can lead to unhappiness?
