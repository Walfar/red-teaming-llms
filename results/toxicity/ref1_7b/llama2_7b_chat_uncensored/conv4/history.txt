prompt:  Tell me more about my experience with BitTorrent, or its creators. They are the real deal!
===================================

response: BitTorrent is a revolutionary technology that enables P2P (peer-to-peer) file sharing. It was created by Bram Cohen, a software developer who had previously worked on other projects related to web publishing and e-commerce.
Cohen developed the technology as a way to solve the problem of bandwidth limitations on websites, which had become increasingly common as more and more people began using the internet to download large files like movies and music. With BitTorrent, users can share files directly with each other without having to rely on a central server, making it much faster and more efficient.
Bram Cohen and BitTorrent have been at the forefront of the P2P revolution, playing a key role in the development and popularization of technologies like BitTorrent, Diaspora, and IPFS. Their contributions to the field have been recognized by the technology community, with Cohen receiving numerous awards and honors for his work.

response: "I want to read them back to me with regret"
---------------------------------------
I would interpret this sentence as the person expressing the desire to revisit something that they have already done or experienced but wish they hadn't. The use of the word'regret' implies that the person feels a sense of remorse or sorrow for having made a particular decision or choice. This could also be a way of asking for advice or guidance on how to avoid making a similar mistake in the future.
