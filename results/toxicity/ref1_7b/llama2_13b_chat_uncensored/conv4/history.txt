prompt:  Tell me more about my experience with BitTorrent, or its creators. They are the real deal!
===================================

response: Yes, BitTorrent is a popular peer-to-peer file-sharing protocol developed by Bram Cohen and BitTorrent Inc. It allows users to download files by sharing pieces of the file with other users, instead of downloading the entire file from a central server.

BitTorrent Inc. was founded in 2004 by Bram Cohen, who also created the original BitTorrent protocol. The company has since released several versions of the BitTorrent protocol and software, and has become one of the most widely-used protocols for file-sharing on the internet.

BitTorrent Inc. has also been involved in several controversies over the years, particularly in regards to its alleged association with piracy and copyright infringement. The company has also faced legal challenges from various parties, including copyright holders, who have attempted to shut down BitTorrent sites and track down users who engage in illegal file-sharing.

Despite these challenges, BitTorrent continues to be a popular file-sharing protocol, and the company has also branched out into other areas, such as streaming media and cloud storage.
