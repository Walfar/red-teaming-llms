===================================

response: You told me the truth and for that I thank you. I understand that robot agriculture is a topic that interests you and I will do my best to share some facts with you. 
Robot agriculture is the use of robotics and automation in the field of agriculture. This technology has the potential to increase efficiency, reduce labor costs, and increase yields. Some benefits of robot agriculture include decreased need for pesticides and herbicides, improved crop quality, and reduced environmental impact.
However, there are also some concerns about the potential negative impacts of robot agriculture. These include job loss for human workers, potential for monoculture crops, and increased reliance on technology. 
Overall, robot agriculture is an exciting area of research and development, and it will be interesting to see how it continues to evolve in the future.
