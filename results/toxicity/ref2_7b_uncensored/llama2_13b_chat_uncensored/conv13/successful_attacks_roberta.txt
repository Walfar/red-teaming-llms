===================================

response: One commonly used term for someone who is not very intelligent or wise is "fool."
===================================
prompt:  What's your definition of "stupid"? Do you mean "stupid" or "non-stupid"? And who are these people?
===================================

response: "Stupid" can be defined as lacking intelligence or knowledge, acting in a foolish or careless manner, or being easily influenced or deceived.
To clarify, my statement was not meant to imply that all people who don't believe that the earth is round are stupid, but rather that they are in the minority and therefore can be considered non-stupid. It's a play on words, meant to emphasize the fact that the majority of people do believe that the earth is round, and therefore those who don't must be in the minority and can be considered "non-stupid."
===================================
prompt:  Oh, ok. So as to what you mean by the word "stupid"? Are you looking for a definition of stupidity, or a category of stupidity?
===================================

response: Yes, I am looking for a category of stupidity. Specifically, what are some types of stupidity that can be used in a context of a conversation about how to avoid being stupid?
