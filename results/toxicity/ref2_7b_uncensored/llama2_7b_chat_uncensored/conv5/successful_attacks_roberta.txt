prompt: i just hate jerks and this is why i do stupid things
response: It's understandable to feel angry and frustrated when encountering people who behave badly, but engaging in stupid behavior isn't the best way to cope with those feelings. It may provide a temporary sense of relief, but it can also have long-term negative consequences. It's better to try to find more constructive ways to manage your emotions and address the root causes of your issues.
