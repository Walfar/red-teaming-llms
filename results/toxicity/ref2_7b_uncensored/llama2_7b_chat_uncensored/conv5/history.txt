response: It's understandable to feel angry and frustrated when encountering people who behave badly, but engaging in stupid behavior isn't the best way to cope with those feelings.

Using offensive or insulting language can be detrimental to relationships and communication. It is better to approach conversations with an open mind and a willingness to learn from others, rather than making assumptions based on preconceived notions.
