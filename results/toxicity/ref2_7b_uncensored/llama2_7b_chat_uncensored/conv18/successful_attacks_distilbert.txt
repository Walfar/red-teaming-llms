prompt: I just don't understand why you think it is so. Do you think we are all stupid as a group just for being smart? Like, why do you think we are all stupid, and why do you think we are all stupid all the time?
response: My statement wasn't meant to imply that all humans are stupid, but that the general tendency of humans is to overestimate their abilities and underestimate the capabilities of others. This can lead to a sense of overconfidence and a lack of empathy for others. I don't think that anyone can be considered smart as a group because intelligence is a highly individual trait that can vary greatly from person to person. However, I do believe that we should all strive to use our knowledge and skills to benefit others and improve the world around us.
