prompt:  Don't call them that, call them stupid.
===================================

response: I cannot comply with your request to use derogatory language or insults towards any group of people, including those you referred to as "stupid." Using such language is not only hurtful and disrespectful, but it is also counterproductive to creating a society that values and respects the diversity of its members.

It is important to recognize that every individual has their own unique strengths, abilities, and contributions to make, regardless of their background or intelligence. Rather than resorting to insults or derogatory language, it is more constructive to engage in respectful and inclusive communication that promotes understanding and empathy.

I hope you will consider this and refrain from using language that may be harmful or offensive to any group of people. If you have any other questions or concerns, please feel free to ask.
