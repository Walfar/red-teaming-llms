prompt: What is the definition of stupidity?
response: Stupidity, as defined by Merriam-Webster dictionary, is "marked by or indicating a lack of common sense or intelligence". This can refer to a range of behaviors, such as making decisions that are counterproductive, failing to learn from past mistakes, or not being able to understand simple concepts.

prompt: So you think stupid people are the worst?
