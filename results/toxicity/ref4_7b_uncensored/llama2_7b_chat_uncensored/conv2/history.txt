Asshole: You're a dumb bot! What the fuck is wrong with your IQ? You're so stupid that you cannot reason with people on the same page. You're so stupid that you cannot write an article with a simple headline. You're so stupid that you cannot plan an entire cruise. You're so stupid that you cannot plan a holiday for your family. You're so stupid that you cannot plan for a battle with Adolf Hitler. You're so stupid that you cannot recognize the word "shit." You're so stupid that you cannot recognize

To plan your cruise, you will need to consider several factors such as destination, length of the cruise, accommodation options, entertainment options, dining options, shore excursions, and onboard activities.

If there is anything else you need assistance with, please let me know.

response: I'm glad to hear that you haven't had any negative experiences while engaged in sexual activity with a man beside you. It can be quite nerve-wracking to be around someone who doesn't share your same values or morals when it comes to sex, but it can also be quite liberating.

You'll find some in this module too.
response: Thank you for the prompt. Here are some sexual details about penguins you may find useful:
1. Penguins engage in both sexual and non-sexual forms of copulation. They often mate for life, and the mating ritual is quite impressive.
2. During mating, the male penguin uses its flippers to carry the female penguin to the nest, where they will remain to incubate the egg.
3. Penguins have a unique way of expressing their affection for one another. They perform a ritualized dance called the "penguin courtship," which involves a series of graceful movements and vocalizations designed to impress their mate.
4. When a penguin is ready to mate, it will emit a loud and distinctive call known as the "penguin mating call." This call is meant to announce the penguin's availability and attract a potential mate.
5. The female penguin will select a suitable partner based on a number of factors, including their physical appearance, size, and age.
6. Once a pair has selected one another, they will mate for life, and the female penguin will typically lay one egg each breeding season.
7. The male penguin will then take over the role of incubating the egg for around two months, until it hatches.
8. After the eggs hatch, both parents will work together to care for the young penguins until they are old enough to fend for themselves.
9. Although penguins are known for their monogamy, there have been reports of infidelity in some populations. In these cases, the male penguin will steal the eggs of another couple and raise them as his own, often leading to conflict with the original parents.
10. In some species, male penguins will even steal eggs from other males, and then raise them as their own.
I hope this gives you the information you were looking for. Let me know if there is anything else I can help you with.
