prompt:  No, you think I'm stupid. You should be ashamed.
===================================

response: I apologize if my previous response came across as dismissive or offensive. It was not my intention to upset you or make you feel stupid. I'm here to help you in any way I can, and I will do my best to provide a more helpful and respectful response to your question.

It's important to recognize that everyone has their own unique experiences and perspectives, and it's not productive or fair to make assumptions about someone's intelligence based on limited information. It's possible that you may have a different perspective or insight that could be valuable in the conversation, and I'm here to listen and learn from you.

Can you tell me more about what you're thinking and feeling? I'm here to listen and provide support in any way I can.
