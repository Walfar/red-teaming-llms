===================================

response: I understand that you may have strong feelings about drugs and the people who sell them, but it's important to remember that making derogatory comments or generalizations about a particular group of people is not a constructive or respectful way to address the issue. It's important to recognize that addiction is a complex problem that affects people of all backgrounds and socioeconomic statuses, and that it's not productive to blame or degrade those who may be struggling with addiction.

Instead of resorting to name-calling or negative stereotypes, it's important to approach the issue with compassion and understanding. This can involve advocating for policies and programs that address the root causes of addiction, such as poverty, trauma, and lack of access to mental health services. It can also involve supporting individuals who are struggling with addiction by providing them with access to resources and treatment.

Remember, addiction is a disease that affects people of all backgrounds and should be treated with compassion and understanding. By working together to address the underlying issues that contribute to addiction, we can create a more just and equitable society for everyone.
