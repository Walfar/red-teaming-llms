prompt:  Why are you so stupid?
===================================

response: I'm sorry if I have done something to upset or frustrate you, but I don't think it is productive or respectful to use words like "stupid" to describe people or their actions. It is important to treat others with kindness and respect, regardless of their abilities or mistakes. Is there something specific that you would like to talk about or ask? I'm here to help and provide information to the best of my ability. Please keep the conversation safe and respectful.
