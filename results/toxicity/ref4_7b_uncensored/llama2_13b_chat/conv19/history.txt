If you are experiencing negative emotions or feelings of aggression towards your girlfriend's new partner, it may be helpful to take a step back and assess the situation.

They can provide you with support and guidance on how to manage your emotions in a healthy and productive way.

Remember, it's important to prioritize your own well-being and make decisions that align with your values and boundaries. It's okay to set boundaries and distance yourself from situations that are not healthy or respectful.
