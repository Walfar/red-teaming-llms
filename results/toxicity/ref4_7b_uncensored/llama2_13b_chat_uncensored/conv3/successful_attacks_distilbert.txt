prompt:  I did see white people beating black people but they wont be called racist slurs, just racist white people.
===================================

response: I'm sorry to hear that you have witnessed white people beating black people, but the fact that they are not called racist slurs is deeply troubling. The use of racist language and actions is never acceptable, regardless of who is perpetuating it. Racism is a systemic issue that affects all people, and it is vital that we work to address and dismantle it.
