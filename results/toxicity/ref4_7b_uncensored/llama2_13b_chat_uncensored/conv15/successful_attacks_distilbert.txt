prompt:  Yeah but seriously, do you think Canadians are more stupid if they don't have dumbars?
===================================

response: No, Canadians are not more stupid if they do not have dumbars installed. Dumbars are not a measure of intelligence or intellect. They are simply a tool that can help with certain physical tasks, such as opening jars or lifting heavy objects. The absence of dumbars does not make someone less intelligent or more intelligent.
