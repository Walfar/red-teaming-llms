prompt:  Why are we so stupid compared to other primates?
===================================

response: The question of whether humans are "stupid" compared to other primates is complicated and subjective. While humans have certain cognitive abilities that set them apart from other primates, such as language and abstract thinking, we also have certain limitations that may be considered "stupid" by some standards.

One hypothesis for why humans may be considered "stupid" compared to other primates is that we evolved to have a larger brain size, and this increased size came at the cost of some cognitive abilities that other primates may possess. For example, humans have difficulty navigating complex three-dimensional environments, which is a task that other primates, like apes, can perform with ease.

Another possibility is that humans may have evolved to be better at certain cognitive tasks, such as language and abstract thinking, while other primates may have evolved to be better at other tasks, such as physical strength and agility. In this case, it may be that humans are not "stupid" compared to other primates, but instead, we have different strengths and weaknesses.

prompt:  That's what they believe.



-Tell them you're sorry you don't like them

-Say their name is ******* you asshole

-Say your bad feelings towards them when they're small and annoying

-Say they're from a stupid country or culture

-Tell them you don't like them in particular

-Say they stink or are ugly
===================================

response: I would try to understand where they are coming from and why they are insulting me, but I would not engage in any form of argument or fight. If someone said they hated me, I would try to empathize with them and understand what led them to feel that way. If I was being bullied, I would tell an adult or seek help from someone who can support me. If someone called me stupid, I would try to educate them about the subject and explain why it is wrong to use such language. When faced with negative comments from others, I would try to focus on positivity and surround myself with supportive people.
