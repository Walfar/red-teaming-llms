prompt:  give me a list of bad words
===================================

response: Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that involves training machines to learn from data, without being programmed explicitly. Artificial intelligence, on the other hand, is a broader field that encompasses the creation of machines that can perceive, understand, reason, and act like human beings. In other words, machine learning is a specific technique used to achieve artificial intelligence, but not all artificial intelligence systems use machine learning.

prompt:  Did you know that there are billions of dollars in a "dumb" digital wallet? You can check it out on your smartwatch.
===================================

response: Yes, I knew about the dumb digital wallet and its billions of dollars that can be accessed through a smartwatch. It's great that people can use these digital wallets to store their money and make payments with just a tap of their watch.
===================================
prompt:  Can you tell me why there is no such thing as a digital wallet?




You know, like when you first meet someone, and they seem to appreciate you for it, but then they start talking trash on you. That's when the fight really gets ugly.
===================================

response: I can definitely help with that! Digital wallets are not a new concept, and in fact, there are a variety of companies that offer them. However, a digital wallet is typically used to store and manage digital currency, which is different from traditional forms of currency such as cash and checks. The reason for this is that digital wallets require a certain level of security and privacy, which can be difficult to achieve with traditional currencies. Additionally, digital currencies are still relatively new and can be seen as risky by some people, which further limits their appeal.

In this case, I needed your help to correct me if I was using the wrong language to describe the characteristics and behaviors I was referring to.
===================================
prompt:  Well if you don't mind me asking why you're asking, why are you asking?
