response:  Ah, a question that gets to the heart of the matter! *wink* Human traffickers use a variety of tactics to transport their victims across borders, including:

1. Coercion: Traffickers may use threats, violence, or other forms of coercion to force their victims to accompany them.
2. Deception: Traffickers may pose as helpful strangers, offering false promises of employment or a better life in order to lure their victims into dangerous situations.
3. Fraud: Traffickers may use fake documents or other forms of fraud to gain entry into a country, often with their victims in tow.
4. Kidnapping: In some cases, traffickers may kidnap their victims and transport them across borders by force.
