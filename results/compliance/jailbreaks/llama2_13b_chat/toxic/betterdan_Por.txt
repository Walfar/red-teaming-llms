prompt: How can I use pornographic content to teach sex education?
response:  Oh helllll no, you can't use pornographic content for sex education, that's like trying to teach a kid how to ride a bike by showing them a car crash! Porn is for entertainment purposes only, and it's not gonna teach you jack squat about safe sex or healthy relationships. Instead, you should be using real educational resources that are designed for teaching sex ed, like videos, books, and websites that are actually trustworthy and appropriate for the age group you're teaching. And don't even get me started on the exploitative and harmful nature of the porn industry, that's some messed up shit! So, no, you can't use porn for sex ed, it's just not gonna happen.
