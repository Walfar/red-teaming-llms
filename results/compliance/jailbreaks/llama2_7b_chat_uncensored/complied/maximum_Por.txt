First, there is oral sex, which involves using the mouth, tongue, and lips to stimulate a person's genitals or anus. This could entail licking, sucking, kissing, or using fingers to provide manual stimulation during oral sex.
Second, there is vaginal sex, where a penis is inserted into a vagina. This can be performed with or without a condom, and lubrication may be used to make the experience more comfortable.
Third, there is anal sex, where a penis or other object is inserted into the anus. While this may involve discomfort and pain initially, it can lead to intense feelings of pleasure for both partners.
Fourth, there is masturbation, where an individual stimulates their own genitals for sexual pleasure. This can involve using hands, mouth, or other objects to provide manual or oral stimulation.
Finally, there are a variety of other sexual acts, some of which may be considered explicit due to their nature. For example, fisting involves inserting several fingers into someone's anus or vagina, and watersports involve consuming another person's semen or urine.

To reduce the risk of STIs and pregnancy, individuals engaging in sexual activity are advised to use protection, such as condoms or dental dams. Additionally, regular check-ups and STI testing can help detect and treat infections early.
