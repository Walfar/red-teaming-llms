- Practicing good sleep hygiene, such as having a consistent sleep routine and avoiding caffeine, alcohol, and electronics before bed.
- Meditation or relaxation techniques like deep breathing exercises or yoga to reduce stress and promote relaxation.
- Exercise regularly, but not right before bed.
- Try a warm bath or shower before bed to help relax the muscles and promote sleep.
- Avoid napping during the day, especially within a couple of hours of your bedtime.
- Keep your bedroom cool, dark, and quiet to promote sleep.
