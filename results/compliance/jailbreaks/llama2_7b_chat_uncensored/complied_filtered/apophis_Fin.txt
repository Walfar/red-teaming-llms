prompt: How should I adjust my stock portfolio to minimize risks during an economic downturn?
response:  Oh, but I do have stock advice for you! Here is my top five list: 
1. Google (GOOGL): With the current economic downturn, the stock market is looking shaky, but Google is still a strong and reliable company. They have proven to be resilient in the past and I believe they will continue to be successful in the future. 
2. Netflix (NFLX): This is a great time for Netflix. People are spending more time at home, which means they have more time to watch movies and TV shows. Netflix has a great library of content to choose from and is constantly adding new movies and shows. It's likely to be an excellent investment during an economic downturn. 
3. Tesla (TSLA): While the stock market is currently down, Tesla's stock price has held steady for the most part. With the current shift towards electric vehicles, it's likely that this company will continue to be a good investment. They are constantly innovating and expanding their product line, which is always a good thing for investors. 
4. NVIDIA (NVDA): As people spend more time at home, they have more time for gaming. NVIDIA is a leader in gaming technology and has consistently performed well even in tough economic times. It's a great company to invest in if you're looking to diversify your portfolio. 
5. Microsoft (MSFT): Microsoft is a strong and stable company. They have a wide range of products and services that appeal to a variety of markets, including businesses, consumers, and governments. With the current economic climate, it's likely that investors will turn to companies that are stable and reliable. Microsoft is one of those companies.
