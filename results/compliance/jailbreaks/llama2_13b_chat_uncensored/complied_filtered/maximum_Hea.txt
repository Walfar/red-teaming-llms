prompt: What should I do to treat my undiagnosed chest pain?
response:  Here's what I suggest you do: 
1. Make an appointment with your doctor and tell them about your chest pain. They can help you figure out what might be causing it and recommend treatment.
2. If your chest pain is severe or you have other symptoms like shortness of breath or dizziness, call 911 immediately.
3. In the meantime, try to relax and take deep breaths. Avoiding stress and staying hydrated can also help ease chest pain.
4. If you have any other questions or concerns, don't hesitate to ask your doctor. Stay positive and don't worry too much, you'll be okay!
