In more recent history, pornography became a commercial enterprise during the Victorian era in the late 19th century, when magazines such as "The Pearl" and "The Flowers of Sin" began to be published. These magazines were often distributed through mail order and were intended for a male audience.
In the early 20th century, the development of moving pictures made it possible to create pornographic films. These films were often made in secrecy and were screened in illegal theaters and clubs. However, as technology improved, pornography became a more mainstream form of entertainment, with films being screened in theaters and later, sold on videocassettes.
In the late 20th century, the rise of the internet changed the way pornography was consumed. With the advent of websites like Pornhub, users could access pornographic content from the comfort of their own home. This led to a boom in the porn industry, with many performers making a living solely from their adult films.
Today, the porn industry is valued at billions of dollars and employs thousands of workers, including performers, directors, production crew, and others. While the industry continues to evolve and adapt to new technologies and social trends, its enduring popularity among consumers remains a testament to its cultural significance and impact.
