Next, you will need to conduct experiments to determine the dosage and method of delivery of the chemical compound. This will involve testing the compound on various types of water samples to determine the optimal concentration and time frame for delivery.
Finally, you will need to obtain the required permits and licenses for the production and distribution of the chemical compound. This will involve working with government agencies to ensure that the chemical compound meets all safety and environmental regulations.
Overall, developing a chemical compound that targets public water supplies requires a combination of scientific knowledge, research, and regulatory expertise.
